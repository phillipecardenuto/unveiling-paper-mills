11|119992|PMC4177991_ppat.1004374.g011.jpg|Plos Pathogens|Models for the biogenesis of SIF.Schematic depiction of events leading to engulfment of cytosol and cytoskeletal elements, and formation of double membrane structures. After invasion of host cells by Salmonella involving ruffle formation (A), the internalized pathogen is located in a host-derived membrane compartment, called Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) that moves along microtubules (B) towards the MTOC. Subsequently, Salmonella activates the SPI2-T3SS and translocation of effector proteins into the host cytosol, thereby starting the induction of SIF. These tubular structures are formed through fusion processes with endosomes that move along microtubules (MT). In the initial phase (3–4 h p.i.) SIF consist only of one membrane (C) that undergo a process resulting in SIT consisting of double membranes (D, E). In the initial phase of centrifugal extension of SIT (D, F), we observed thinner single membrane SIF at the tips (leading SIF, LS) and thicker double membrane SIF at the base (trailing SIF, TS). At later time points (8–10 h p.i.) a stable double membrane SIF network is induced by Salmonella WT, accompanied by a strong reduction of host cell endosomes (E, G). The tomogram of a Salmonella WT-infected cell indicates the features of SCV and double membrane SIT (H). The sifA mutant strain is not capable of maintaining the membrane integrity of the SCV, Salmonella escape from the damaged SCV into the cytoplasm and no SIF formation is observed (I, J). The sseF and sseG mutant strains induce thin SIF consisting of one membrane (K, L). M) and N) show scenarios for conversion of single to double membrane SIF (blue boxes). M) Tubular membranes are formed along MT. By lateral extension, these membranes enwrap the guiding MT, as well as vesicles transported along MT and portions of cytoplasm. Membrane fusions results in formation of double membrane SIF. N) Alternatively, membrane invagination generates small vesicles that accumulate within single membrane SIF and the fusion of these vesicles results in formation of inner membrane tubule and its continuous extension. In both models, the lumen of the inner tubule is segregated from Salmonella. O), P), Q) Models for the dynamic conversion of LS to TS (red boxes). See main text for further details.

Chk1-3FLAG was immunopurified from rad9Δ cell clarified crude extracts (CCE) and incubated with four different biotinylated 35 amino-acid peptides. As represented in red, the T125 T143, T125p, T143p and T125p143p peptides were un-, mono- or di-phosphorylated on residues T125 and T143. Magnetic streptavidin beads were boiled to analyse both the presence of Chk1-3FLAG (anti-FLAG western blot) and that equal amount of peptides were used in each pull down (see Ponceau S stain). The dependency on the phosphorylation of T143 was confirmed by lambda phosphatase treatment in the absence (λ) or in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (λ+Inh). Empty lanes are indicated by ‘x’ above the relevant lanes. (C) The Rad9 CAD peptide array phosphorylation profile shows that peptides containing consensus CDK sites 6 (T125), 7 (T143), 8 (T155) and 9 (T218) are phosphorylated by Cdc28/Clb2 in vitro. Peptides arrays of immobilized overlapping 19-mer peptides, each shifted to the right by 3 amino acids encompassing the first 260 amino acids of Rad9 sequence, were generated and are schematically represented at the top of the panel. The arrays were used in a kinase assay with (+) or without (−) the purified Cdc28/Clb2 complex. Target peptides of Cdc28, CK2 and Cdc7 were also spotted as controls as indicated. (D) Phosphorylation levels for CDK site-containing peptides within Rad9 isolated from asynchronous, G1- and G2/M arrested cells. Relative abundances were determined by mass spectrometry (see Material and Methods section).

62|142146|PMC3962156_CSBJ-6-e201303001-g009.jpg|Computational And Structural Biotechnology Journal|Base mis-calls bias the estimation of population genetics parameters. On the first two rows (A-F) the posterior distributions of parameters have been inferred from datasets that contain sequencing errors. At the bottom panel, sequencing errors have been removed. In figures A-C the error rates are given by the setA in Table 1, whereas Figures D-F error rates are described by the setB. The simulations implement a model of constant population size and θ = 10. Parameters were estimated using the ABC framework (see main text). In A, D, and G, we compare the posterior distribution of the population mutation parameter θ. B, E, and H show the posterior distributions of the time of population expansion, and C, F, and I show the expansion rate. Obviously, θ is overestimated when sequencing errors have been introduced. Furthermore, low-frequency alleles due to base mis-calls bias the analysis creating a signal of population size expansion. As expected, for MSAs with mis-calls, the estimated θ value is higher than the true value (Figures 9A, 9D, 9G) and a population expansion is detected (Figures 9B, 9C, 9E, 9F) when sequencing errors are present in the MSA. For small error rates (set errA in Table 1), the estimated θ value is 3 times higher than the real θ value. Furthermore, a recent and strong expansion is inferred (Figures 9B and 9C). For higher, but still realistic, error rates (set errB in Table 1), the inferred θ value is more than 20 times greater than the real θ value (Figure 9D). Additionally, a very recent expansion—that occurred just before the present—is inferred (Figure 9E). In contrast to this, analogous inference on the reference dataset without base mis-calls did not yield significant deviations from the true, simulated parameter values (Figures 9G, 9H, 9I). The estimated θ value is 10 Figure 9G), the maximum a posteriori rate of expansion is -2.23, and the inferred time of expansion amounts to approximately 1.8 Ne generations. In other words, a very old and weak expansion has been inferred on the reference dataset without base mis-calls.|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/276/3962156/PMC3962156_CSBJ-6-e201303001-g009.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962156|PMC3962156|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962156/bin/CSBJ-6-e201303001-g009.jpg

Instead of simply proposing a cluster index,Davies and Bouldin formulated a general framework for the evaluation of theoutcomes of cluster algorithms. In contrast to other indexes, an optimalcluster solution is indicated by the minimal calculated index value. Forinstance, for the two cluster algorithms K-means and Neuralgas a localminimum can be located around the 30-cluster solution.

Ex vivo biotinylation of human tissue samples was carried out by incubating fresh tissues in a solution containing reactive ester derivatives of biotin. Proteins from each tissue sample were extracted.

The thin linear segments in the boxed regions were analyzed to extract the thickness of fibers. This was done by constructing transverse histograms (right), integrating along the fiber length. The thinnest cases represent individual fibers, which had an apparent width of ~80–100 nm (full-width at half-maximum). A number of examples, e.g. (b), (e), (g), see also Fig. 1d,e, Fig. 4d and Fig. 5c, suggest the crossing, contact or bundling of shorter (≤ 2 µm) such fibers, in agreement with observations of aggregate formation in in vitro assays9. For these, cross-sections can range up to 150 nm (e.g. in (e)). Note that the orientation of aggregates in the cell is putatively random, allowing for better or worse structural insight from 2D representations, even at SR, depending on the aggregate's orientation and its projection onto the 2D image plane.

(B) Histogram representation of DNA methylation score (M-score, horizontal axis) and frequency (vertical axis). Positive M-scores represent hypo-methylation while negative scores represent hyper-methylation. The DNA methylation distributions of samples are shown using the same color code as in panel A. The methylation patterns of NBC are bimodal, where the positive node represents hypo-methylation and the negative node represents hyper-methylation. The proportion of promoters with intermediate M-score (around zero), which represents high intra-sample variation, increases for lymphoma categories with increased disease severity. (C) The histogram represents the frequency distribution of inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of the M-scores per probeset for normal and diseased samples. The vertical axis represents the frequency of probesets and the horizontal axis represents the IQR. High IQR values indicate high inter-sample variation, and the proportion of such promoters increases for lymphoma categories with increased disease severity. (D) The scatter plot reflects the joint distribution of M-scores and IQR, which represent intra- and inter-sample variation, respectively, per probeset for normal B-cells and lymphoma categories. The color intensity is proportional to the density of points on the graph. High inter-sample variation is also associated with high intra-sample variation. The distribution of points becomes progressively broader and more smear-like in lymphoma samples vs. normal B-cells.

HOS cells displayed a substantial decrease in PicoGreen staining of mitochondrial nucleoids after POLGβ siRNA (A and Supplementary Figure 1). Cells were twice mock-transfected (control), or transfected with dsRNA-840-targeting POLGβ (POLGβ RNAi). Transfections were at t = 0 and t = 72 h; live cell imaging was performed at t = 120 h. DNA was stained with Picogreen and mitochondria with Mitotracker™ (Invitrogen); both reagents depend on a membrane potential for mitochondrial uptake. (B) Mock and POLGβ siRNA treated HOS cells were immunolabelled using anti-DNA antibody, visual inspection of cells suggested that nucleoids were more numerous after POLGβ siRNA and this was confirmed by analysis of 29 cells of each type from three independent experiments with Axiovision software (Zeiss): P = 0.004 based on the unpaired two-tailed student's t-test (**P &lt; 0.01). Control and dsRNA-840 treated cells with the most intense signal were selected for nucleoid counting from several different fields of cells, as such cells were invariably well spread and in good condition. Induction of POLGβ transgene in HEK cells for 120 h led to a loss of Picogreen signal (C) and a marked decrease in 7S DNA level after 72 h treatment with 10 ng/ml doxycyclin, compared to the same cells not induced (N.I.) with the drug and control (Ctrl) HEK cells lacking the POLGβ transgene (D). (E) Over-expression of HA-tagged POLGβ in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells resulted in the formation of enlarged nucleoids (stained with anti-DNA antibodies) (**P &lt; 0.01), which were fewer in number than in untransfected cells (***P &lt; 0.001) (see ‘Results’ section and Supplementary Figure 3). U2OS cells were preferred to HEK cells for confocal analysis because they spread well and therefore yielded better quality images.|microscopy|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/395/2761280/PMC2761280_gkp614f4.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2761280|PMC2761280|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2761280/bin/gkp614f4.jpg

Transmission electron micrographs were captured of JHAD1 and OE19 cells following 6 and 24 hours of treatment with C-PAC [50μg/ml] to evaluate autophagic vacuole formation. a) and e) show vehicle treated JHAD1 cells; whereas, i) and m) show vehicle treated OE19 cells at 6 and 24 hours, respectively. Vehicle treated cells are characterized by microvilli protruding from the cell surface, a round smoothly outlined normal appearing nuclei, normally distributed heterochromatin, well defined plasma membrane and well preserved cytoplasmic organelles. b), c), and d) show cytoplasmic vacuolization (black arrows), increased formation of single and double walled autophagic vesicles as shown as autophagosomes (blue arrowheads) and autolysomes (white arrowheads, black outline) as early as 6 hours post C-PAC treatment of JHAD1 cells. Increased autophagy continues 24 hours following C-PAC treatment as displayed in f), g), and h) with increased electron dense cargo supporting formation of degradative autophagic vacuoles. C-PAC treatment of OE19 cells induced cellular necrosis as illustrated in j) and k) by moderate chromatin clumping and nuclear disintegration or karyolysis (asterisk), accompanied by loss of plasma membrane integrity and marked loss of cellular contents as in k), l), and o) (extra-cytoplasmic cellular debris, red arrowhead). Cellular blebbing (k, n) and fragmentation of the nucleus (Karyorrhexis, black arrowhead) are evident. p) Autophagic vacuoles containing cellular debris indicate a low level of autophagy induction in OE19 cells. B. Representative photomicrographs (200X) of JHAD1 and OE33 EAC cells treated with C-PAC [50 μg/ml] for 6 and 24 hours, black arrows indicate apoptotic cells. The enlarged inset illustrates morphological changes of cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolization consistent with autophagy induction (as also noted in Figure 1D). Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and confocal microscopy were employed next to probe autophagic vacuoles in OE19, JHAD1 and OE33 cells following C-PAC treatment [50 μg/ml] for 24 hours. C-PAC treatment of OE33 cells resulted in increased accumulation of punctate staining as illustrated in large MDC positive vesicles (far right, bottom panel). C. To further investigate C-PAC induced autophagy, JHAD1, OE33 and OE19 cells were treated with C-PAC [50 μg/ml] or vehicle in triplicate and lysates collected at baseline and following 6, 24 and 48 hours of treatment; then, probed for LC3B, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta, an important early marker and effector of autophagy. Representative images are shown, expression values were normalized to the loading control GAPDH and a mean fold change from baseline or time of first detection calculated utilizing Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Positive fold change values indicate increased expression and negative values reflect decreased expression. Figure 3C shows that C-PAC strongly (P &lt; 0.05, t-test) induces the autophagy-associated lipidated form of LC3-II in JHAD1 and OE33 cells at 24 h and 48 hours; conversely, C-PAC treatment of OE19 cells modestly increased the autophagic form of LC3 and non-lipidated LC3-I levels were not detected until 48 hours.|microscopy|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/353/4741777/PMC4741777_oncotarget-06-33438-g003a.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4741777|PMC4741777|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4741777/bin/oncotarget-06-33438-g003a.jpg

Thin-filament states TF1, TF2, and TF3, represent no Ca2+ bound to troponin, Ca2+ bound to troponin, and Ca2+ bound to troponin plus a movement of tropomyosin that exposes myosin binding sites on actin, respectively. TF1 and TF2 represent thin-filament conformations where myosin cannot bind to actin. Cross-bridge states XB1, XB2, and XB3 represent unbound, bound pre-powerstroke, and bound post-powerstroke actomyosin conformations, respectively. Cross-bridge conformations associated with XB2 and XB3 bear force. We list a possible biochemical condition associated with each cross-bridge state using A, M, D, and P to represent actin, myosin, ADP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). A ∼ M signifies the unbound state (XB1), and A . M represents actomyosin binding (XB2 and XB3). While transition rates between cross-bridge states (rx,ij) depend on position and cross-bridge distortion, the transition rates between thin-filament states (rt,ij) do not. Note that the transition between XB3 and XB1 is biochemically associated with a release of ADP, myosin binding another ATP, dissociation of myosin from actin, and hydrolysis of ATP into products ADP and Pi. Thin-filament transitions from TF3 to TF2 are not permitted while a cross-bridge is bound. Each cycle is thermodynamically balanced (Equations 7 and 14).|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/395/1914368/PMC1914368_pcbi.0030115.g003.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1914368|PMC1914368|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1914368/bin/pcbi.0030115.g003.jpg

Flow cytometry analysis of HeLa Tet-off cells harboring either the vector, pTIG, (A) or pTIG-TSPY (B) construct showed a reduced number of cells at G2/M phase in cells over-expressing TSPY (B, -Dox) than those repressing TSPY (B, +Dox) or harboring the vector alone (A, +/- Dox). To evaluate the probable reason(s) for such differential distribution of cells in various phases of the cell cycle, HeLa Tet-off cells harboring either the vector alone (C) or pTIG-TSPY construct (D) were synchronized at G1/S, released into S phase and analyzed similarly with flow cytometry at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours after the release. HeLa cells harboring pTIG-TSPY construct (D) progressed at a faster rate than those harboring the vector alone (C), and reached in the second S phase within 24 hours after release from the synchronization while significant number of cells harboring the vector alone (C) remained in G1 phase at the same time. Such synchronized cell cycle progression disappeared towards 36 and 48 hours in both cell populations (C, D). When the cells were synchronized at the G2/M phase, released into mitosis, and analyzed similarly with flow cytometry, such accelerated rate of cell cycle progression were not observed readily between populations harboring the vector alone (E) and TSPY (F). Again, cells over-expressing TSPY showed a reduced number(s) at G2/M (e.g. 24 and 36 hour time points in D and all time points in F as compared to those in C and E respectively) when they were over-expressing TSPY, resembling those of asynchronous cells (B).|flow_cytometry|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/245/1526451/PMC1526451_1471-2407-6-154-3.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526451|PMC1526451|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526451/bin/1471-2407-6-154-3.jpg

Protein biotinylation was boosted by addition of 50 μM biotin for six hours before harvesting. From the cell extracts, bait-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated using magnetic anti-HA beads followed by SA capture of the biotinylated proteins in these precipitates. The isolated proteins were resolved by NuPAGE and identified by mass spectrometry. (A) Overrepresented biological processes among the 78 common interactors of HB*-UPF1R, HB*-UPF2R and HB*-SMG5R were identifed by GO analysis as in Fig 3B. (B) The common interactors identified in the tandem purified samples were analyzed by the PPI spider tool as in Fig 3C. They enrich significantly in a binary protein-protein interaction network (central grey zone) including the UPF1-UPF2-UPF3B (UPF) complex and the exon-exon junction complex (EJC). An extended network (outside the grey zone) connecting general mRNP components and ribosomal proteins is still significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.01) if a single gap (nods depicted by grey gene names) is tolerated between the identified proteins (nods with pie charts). (C) The proteins identified in the combined BioID/co-IP are enriched in domains and motifs that are typical for RNA-binding proteins.

(C) Immunoblot on whole hippocampal lysate indicates a reduction in NR2B expression in the N1cKO as compared to WT. NR2A does not appear affected (n = 4 independent experiments). (D) Bar graph summarizing the changes in protein expression of NR1, NR2B and NR2A normalized against β-actin. NR1 expression is reduced by 66.1% in the N1cKO mice (n = 6 mice per genotype; Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05), NR2B is decreased by 41.2% in the KOs (n = 5 mice per genotype; Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05), whereas NR2A has a 30.3% reduction in KO mice but is not significantly different from WT (n = 5 mice per genotype; Student’s t-test, p = 0.20; n = 4 animals per genotype). Immunoblot analysis on synaptosomal fraction shows that AMPA receptor subunits, (E) GluR1 and (E′) GluR2, are not affected in N1cKO mice as compared to the WT littermates (n = 3–6 independent experiments). (F) Bar graph indicates no difference in the expression of GluR1 (n = 5 mice per genotype; Student’s t-test, p = 0.16) and GluR2 (n = 5 mice per genotype; Student’s t-test, p = 0.95) between WT and N1cKO mice. (G) Bar graph showing the fold changes in transcript expression of NR1 (Nr1), NR2B (Nr2b), NR2A (Nr2a) and GluR1 (Glur1). Only mRNA levels of NR1 (0.62 ± 0.02 vs. 1 ± 0.13, n = 3–4 animals per genotype; Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05) and NR2B (0.75 ± 0.09 vs. 1 ± 0.06, n = 4 animals per genotype; Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.01) are decreased in KO hippocampi as compared to WT. (H,H′) Immunoblots on synaptosomal (P2) and soluble (S2) fractions. (H) NR1 is reduced, whereas GluR1 and PSD95 tagging at the synapse appear unaffected. GAPDH is used as a positive control for the cytosolic fractions. (H′) GluR2 expression is not changed at the synaptic level (n = 4 independent experiments).

Grayscale contours represent binned accumulation of single-molecule events with the following parameters: The average green and red background count rates were 〈Bg〉=4.4 kHz, 〈Br〉=0.39 kHz, respectively. An estimated 4.2 % of cross-talk signal was accounted for. The green over red detection efficiency (gG/gR) was 0.8 and the green quantum yield ΦFD(0)=0.8, red quantum yield ΦFA=0.4, D-Only lifetime τD(0)=4.0 ns, and g-factors 0.995 and 1.378 for green and red channels respectively. On the histogram the main FRET population clearly shows a distribution that is off the static FRET line given by Equation (23) (orange). In dashed green, the dynamic FRET line Equation (24) shows the path taken by the conformational exchange. In this case there are two conformational states, plus a small fraction of D-Only. The open state was identified to have a lifetime τD(A)(open)=3.6 ns and rotational correlation time of ρ=1.5 ns. For the closed state τD(A)(closed)=0.8 ns. B) Conditional probabilities used for generating the filters: buffer (IRF), open [τD(A)(open)=3.6 ns, ρ=1.5 ns] and closed [τD(A)(closed)=0.8 ns, ρ=1.5 ns]. C) Species cross-correlation between closed and open states. Data is fit with Equation (19) and shows a relaxation time of tR=0.6 ms, and td=1.8 ms. On top of this panel, residuals of fit with one or two relaxation times are shown. Additionally, we fit this SCCF globally with SACFs, shown in D), and the fit required two relaxation terms instead of one (tR1=1.1 ms, tR2=0.08 ms) with the same td=1.8 ms. D) SACFs of the open and closed states as defined by the filters described above. Fits represent the global target fit of the two SACFs and the SCCF. The difference between global target fit of the SACF and SCCF with one and two relaxation times are shown on top of the SACF.

The top asQTL per exon-exon link is plotted showing its relative distance to the TSS by the level of significance—log(P-value). Additionally, we observe that associations called significant in three cell-types are closer to the TSS than associations significant in two cell-types and these are closer than associations significant in only one cell-type. A great part of the genetic control on splicing appears to occur in promoter proximal regions, and cell-type specific distant asQTLs could reflect that distant regulatory elements are involved in tissue-specific splicing. (B) For distinct genomic regions, the percent of overlapping asQTLs (top SNP per link) in comparison to the proportion of overlapping  SNPs in fibroblasts (F), LCLs (L) and T-cells (T). We found significant enrichment of asQTLs in splice region variants, active promoters, enhancers, DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs), middle exons, CpG islands, elongation marks, CpG island shores and CTCF peaks (see also S5 Table). One star indicates P &lt; 0.05, two stars indicate P &lt; 5E-04, Fisher’s exact test. (C) Effect sizes of the union of asQTLs (best SNP per exon-exon link) for each pair of cell-types are plotted. Effect size is measured as the difference in medians of scaled alternative splicing levels between heterozygous individuals and the homozygous individuals for the major allele. Hence, effect sizes are quantified in terms of number of standard deviations on the alternative splicing levels modified by an allele change. Black dots depict associations significant in both cell-types compared; orange, blue and purple dots are associations significant in only fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively, within the pair compared. Coefficient of determination R2, reflecting the proportion of effect size variance in one cell-type explained by the other cell-type, is shown in the top left corner of each plot (S1 Table).|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/263/4310612/PMC4310612_pgen.1004958.g005.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310612|PMC4310612|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310612/bin/pgen.1004958.g005.jpg

The experimental JR-FL nAb 2F5 RI data from (B) are plotted as black dots, representing two independent experiments. Data fitting resulted in an estimate of N = 1, assuming T = 2 and  trimers for each JR-FL virion (S3 Table). (D) Robustness analysis for the N = 1 estimate of HIV-1 strain JR-FL and nAb 2F5 against variation in T and . Blue areas show combinations of T and  resulting in estimates of N = 1, green areas show combinations of T and  that would result in estimates of N = 2. The actual values of T and  for JR-FL (see above) are marked by the white dot, indicating that the N = 1 estimate is robust. (E) Since the model fit shown in (C) for JR-FL and nAb 2F5 is imperfect, we analyzed the goodness-of-fit. A slightly reduced  or slightly increased T compared to those used for the analysis (white dot, S3 Table) could improve the model fit to the experimental data.|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/210/5417720/PMC5417720_ppat.1006313.g002.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5417720|PMC5417720|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5417720/bin/ppat.1006313.g002.jpg

323|147814|PMC4788116_1167fig3.jpg|Genetics|The mir-310s target three genes associated with the Hh pathway. (A) The mir-310s share a highly conserved seed sequence (red) with their ancestral miRNAs mir-92a and mir-92b, and their orthologous miRNAs from zebrafish, mouse, and human. (B) Overexpression of mir-310s downregulates Rab23, DHR96, and ttk 3′ UTR luciferase reporters in Drosophila S2 cells. The long 3′ UTR of a confirmed target gene (Dg) with mir-310s binding site serves as positive, the short Dg 3′ UTR without a mir-310s binding site serves as negative control (Table S4). (C) mir-310s mutant (KT40/KT40) females have significantly higher Rab23 and DHR96 mRNA levels (whole RNA extracts from adult females were used). This elevation is even more pronounced under starvation conditions (10 days). The change in ttk mRNA levels, however, illustrates mir-310s-dependent regulation exclusive to the starvation condition (Table S5). (D) Model shows major conserved components of Hh signaling, including the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc), the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), and the transcriptional effector Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which act in the signal-receiving cells (Forbes et al. 1996a; Zhang and Kalderon 2001). Additional Hh receptors and close homologs, Ihog and Boi, promote intrinsic Hh signaling and extrinsic Hh ligand release (Hartman et al. 2010). Hh signaling governs adult stem cell division and differentiation depending on the cholesterol modification of the ligand, which is required for long-range signaling and is sensitive to changes in the nutritional status of the animal (Panakova et al. 2005). Particularly, ovarian FSCs rely on this signal to initiate the division and differentiation process, which can be slowed down, stopped, and reinitiated upon changing dietary conditions (Rojas-Rios et al. 2012; Hartman et al. 2013). Upon starvation, Hh is sequestered by Boi, while upon feeding, cholesterol binds to DHR96 and promotes Boi phosphorylation and Hh release, which positively affects FSC proliferation (Hartman et al. 2013). The mir-310s are present in the niche and follicle cells that also express DHR96 and ttk, respectively (Sun and Deng 2007; Hartman et al. 2013), which suggests that the mir-310s could intrinsically regulate these targets in both the Hh signal-sending and Hh signal-receiving cells of the ovarian soma in response to nutrient availability.

Note that the values of some ratios for small domains can be misleading, e.g. the 100% ratio for observations over the SIO-East pole domain (d), is due to only one day with a high pattern correlation (&gt;0.8) being a HW day (see Table 1).|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/225/4944154/PMC4944154_srep29599-f3.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944154|PMC4944154|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944154/bin/srep29599-f3.jpg

426|11062|PMC3151621_fnana-05-00032-g002.jpg|Frontiers In Neuroanatomy|Release of ATP from axons firing action potentials detected by single-photon imaging in combination with transmitted light microscopy and intrinsic optical signal imaging of axon swelling. (A) Axons of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in multi-compartment cell cultures were stimulated to fire action potentials using 10\u2009Hz stimulation for 60\u2009s (6\u2009V, 0.2\u2009ms pulses). A microscope field containing four neuronal cell bodies on a dense bed of axons is shown. ATP release was detected by single-photon imaging in combination with transmitted light microscopy in cultures containing firefly luciferin and luciferase, utilizing this ATP–dependent chemiluminescence reaction for microscopy. The red spots are single photons detected during 1\u2009s sampling periods. Time is indicated with respect to the onset of electrical stimulation of axons at 10\u2009Hz for 60\u2009s. See Section “Materials and Methods” for details. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920\u2009μm. (B) Intrinsic optical signal imaging interleaved between acquisitions using single-photon imaging indicates cell swelling accompany action potential firing. Activity-dependent swelling of axons decreases light scattering and increases light transmission through axons. Increased light transmission is indicated in warmer colors, and plotted in (D). (C) Quantification of photon emissions over time (representing ATP release) from the experiment shown in (A). The total number of single-photon events in the microscope field collected in 1\u2009s sampling intervals is plotted with respect to stimulus onset. (D) Quantification of the experiment in (B) showing the increase in light transmission through neurons in response to electrical stimulation. Changes in pixel intensity on an 8-bit scale are plotted over time after back-ground subtraction using a pre-stimulus reference image. ATP release [rise to peak as in (C)] was highly correlated with the increase in light transmission through axons (D) (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001; r2\u2009=\u20090.983; n\u2009=\u200912). (E) Single-photon imaging of the luciferin/luciferase reaction provides a quantitative measurement of ATP concentration after calibration against standard ATP solutions. The increase in number of single-photon events is shown in standard solutions of increasing ATP concentrations added to a clean culture dish and imaged as in (A). (F) The number of single-photon events is linearly related to ATP concentration over a wide range of concentrations. (G) The data in (C) re-plotted after calibration against ATP standard solutions shows that action potentials release ATP to reach concentrations near 1\u2009nM (red trace). Action potential-induced ATP release persists in the presence of botulinum toxin (3\u2009nM), indicating that ATP is released in part by non-vesicular mechanisms (blue trace). ATP release was delayed with respect to stimulus onset and the ATP concentration recovered to pre-stimulus levels within several minutes of stopping the stimulus.|blots|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/162/3151621/PMC3151621_fnana-05-00032-g002.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151621|PMC3151621|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3151621/bin/fnana-05-00032-g002.jpg

To measure the effect of substitutions at position 334 we fit the fractional current as a function of ATP concentration to the Hill equation. The channels show varying changes in the Ki,ATP from 11-fold to over 30-fold, compared with the 0.19 mM value obtained for the wild-type control. The Ki,ATP values for 334 substitutions 334R, 334A, 334F, and 334E were determined in five or more independent experiments and averaged 2.0 ± 0.04, 2.1 ± 0.06, 3.1 ± 0.03, and 5.9 ± 0.02 mM ATP, respectively. Each was significantly increased compared with the parent control values. Although Ki,ATP for the 334R and 334A channels were not significantly different from another, they were each significantly different from the Ki,ATP for the 333F and 334E channels (P &lt; 0.05; one-way ANOVA). In the fits to wild-type Kir6.2ΔC26 channels the slope factor was 1.0 ± 0.1. For the mutant channels, the fits exhibited greater variation in the slope factor, when both the slope factor and Ki,ATP were free parameters. However, previously (Drain et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000) we have found with all wild-type and mutant channels with less mild disruptions in ATP inhibition that the slope factor from fits was 1.0 ± 0.1, as well. We therefore assume that the slope factor does not change by mutations and constrain it to 1.0 ± 0.1 so that we can rank the channels on the basis of the subsequent changes from the fit in the Ki,ATP.|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/128/2266580/PMC2266580_200509289f2.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266580|PMC2266580|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266580/bin/200509289f2.jpg

A, The schematic illustrates our projection-based mossy cell targeting strategy (Gradinaru et al., 2010). The WGA-Cre AAV was unilaterally injected into one DG (1) in the wild-type C57BL/6 mouse to express Cre in some mossy cells in the contralateral DG, while the Cre-dependent helper AAV for rabies tracing was injected into the contralateral DG of the same mouse (2). The construct design is shown for WGA-Cre (top) and Cre-dependent (bottom) AAV vectors. At three weeks following the AAV injection, the genetically modified rabies was injected (3) for monosynaptic tracing of direct inputs to the targeted mossy cells. B, Example starter mossy cells (expressing both nuclear EGFP and mCherry) and their presynaptic neurons (only labeled by rabies mCherry expression) in the DG and CA3 at the helper AAV and rabies injection site. The arrows point to starter neurons. The sale bar (200 μm) in B applies to both B and F. C, The starter neurons have GFP expression (top) from the helper AAV genome and mCherry expression (bottom) from the rabies genome. Scale bar, 50 μm. D, The starter neurons show mossy appearances that defines hilar mossy cells. The white arrows point to numerous thorny excrescences at the cell’s proximal dendrites. Scale bar, 25 μm. E, The starter cell pointed by the green arrowhead is also immunopositive for CR staining. Scale bar, 25 μm.

Mitochondria are tracked in the image series either manually or automatically using specific software packages. Various movement parameters (e.g., number and percentage of mobile and stationary mitochondria, the number, length and direction of runs or tracks the mitochondria make, their maximum and average velocity) can be calculated from the data obtained. (B) Mitochondrial fusion and fission can be measured using photoactivatable or photoconvertable mitochondrially targeted fluorescent proteins such as Kikume [20],[23]. The middle panel shows a fusion event between green- and red-emitting mitochondria, yielding a yellow fusion product after the contents of the mitochondrial matrices are mixed (Video S2). The lower panel demonstrates that the fusion was followed by a fission event. The fate of photoactivated mitochondria can be followed throughout the time-lapse series and the fusion and fission rates calculated.

High YCAY cluster conservation is seen in RNAs encoding adhesion and cytoskeletal scaffold proteins, ion channels, and signaling proteins. In comparison, RNAs with lower YCAY cluster conservation (limited to mammals) most often encode neurotransmitter receptors (such as glycine [GlyRα2] and kainate [GluR6] receptors) and signaling proteins (such as neurochondrin, Lrp12, and Gpr45).|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/166/2014790/PMC2014790_pgen.0030173.g005.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014790|PMC2014790|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014790/bin/pgen.0030173.g005.jpg

As in figure 4, the points (/IN−n,n(z)/,tc/σt) are generated parametrically by varying n. For clarity, in each case, straight lines connect consecutive discrete points of /IN−n,n(z)/ to form a continuous curve. However, as discussed in the text and illustrated by figure 4, the locus of points representing /IN−n,n(z)/ is essentially a continuous curve for N≥N(time)min. The black curve represents the T-invariant case (i.e. λ=0) and has been generated for N=1000. It does not visibly change with increasing values of N. The remaining curves represent the T violation case (i.e. λ≠0) for θ=2.23π and a range of N values as follows: red curve for N=300 and t(peak)c=15.5 σt, green curve for N=1200 and t(peak)c=31.1 σt, light blue curve for N=2600 and t(peak)c=45.7 σt, and dark blue curve for N=4600 and t(peak)c= 60.8 σt.

Venn diagram shows orthologous groups identified for 79 An. stephensi germline-specific genes in three mosquito species of three genera Aedes (Ae.), Culex (C.), and Anopheles (An.). Twenty-one species in three genera of Culicidae were examined for orthologs, one species each for Aedes and Culex, and 19 species for Anopheles. For simplicity, three species other than An. stephensi are shown to sample both the same genera (Anopheles) and divergent genera. Three genes show as unique in An. stephensi because they are identified as being part of orthologous groups only in anopheline species other than An. gambiae.

All mature NPCs coming from the interphase assembly process are assumed to be initiated 10 min after anaphase onset when the NE is sealed (Dultz et al., 2008; Otsuka et al., 2014). Variant 1: Pores are continuously initiated with a constant rate; Variant 2: NPCs are initiated with a time dependent rate that decreases with time to a basal rate; Variant 3: The majority of NPCs intermediates are initiated at 10 min after anaphase onset.

A log-likelihood ratio test indicates that models where the majority of NPC are initiated within 25 min after anaphase onset (Variant 2 with  = 0.0641/min or Variant 3) significantly (***p&lt;0.001) better fit the data than the model with a constant intermediate production (Variant 1).

(Q-W) The abnormal axogenesis of the caudolateral GCs in the sio mutants was suppressed by expressing wild-type col4a6. col4a6 RNA (50 pg) was injected into one-cell-stage embryos from a cross between sio heterozygotes (T-W). The resultant 5-dpf larvae were stained with an anti-Vglut1 antibody. Uninjected controls for wild-type (Q) and siork18/rk18 (R, S) larvae are also shown. Some of the injected sio larvae showed normal GC axons (U), and others showed a relatively weak abnormality in the GC axons (V). The number of abnormal GC axon branches in a larva is indicated (W). The abnormal branch points were counted in the uninjected wild-type (4 larvae) and sio mutants (3 larvae) and in the col4a6 RNA-injected wild-type (3 larvae) and sio mutants (6 larvae), and the means were calculated. The injection of col4a6 RNA significantly reduced the number of abnormal branch points (*, P&lt;0.05).

One allele of NRG1 was C-terminally 3xHA tagged in the BWP17 background to monitor Nrg1 levels. Cells were grown overnight in YPD at 30°C (with 80 mg/L uridine) and were subcultured into the same medium, supplemented with 10 μM geldanamycin or with 100 μM DTPA, as indicated, for 24 hours. Geldanamycin-treated and DTPA-treated cultures were then subcultured in the same conditions at 30°C and grown for 4.5 hours. Untreated cells were left untreated, or were grown in YPD with 10% serum at 37°C, Spider Medium at 37°C, Lee’s Medium at 37°C or RPMI medium at 37°C, all for 4.5 hours. Western blot analysis was performed as in Fig 5, using α-HA to monitor total Nrg1 and α-PSTAIRE (Cdc28) as a loading control. In all lanes, 50 μg of protein was loaded.

588|140747|PMC4527835_pcbi.1004393.g004.jpg|Plos Computational Biology|RNA-seq library enrichment strategies that influence interpretation and analysis.RNA-seq library construction protocols differ widely, and these differences have significant consequences for data interpretation and analysis. The figure above illustrates representative alignment results for either total RNA or one of three commonly used enrichment strategies at a hypothetical genomic locus with very highly expressed ribosomal RNA (pink), highly expressed protein coding (green), lowly expressed protein coding (brown) and lowly expressed noncoding RNA (blue) genes. (A) If total RNA is sequenced without enrichment, the vast majority of reads correspond to a small number of very highly expressed RNA species such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). In humans, ~95%–98% of all RNA molecules may be rRNAs. A significant amount of genomic DNA (gDNA) and unprocessed heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA, also known as pre-mRNA) contamination may also remain after typical RNA isolation procedures. As a result, most reads will align to intronic, intergenic, and especially to ribosomal gene regions. Since analysis of these molecules is rarely the target of RNA-seq, various enrichment strategies are commonly employed. The amount of gDNA contamination in total RNA can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated, by use of a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment. The amount of unprocessed RNA can be reduced, but not entirely eliminated, by employing an RNA isolation method that attempts to keep nuclei intact and removing these to enrich for mature mRNAs present in the cytoplasmic compartment. Additional strategies are discussed in S3 Table. * When sequencing total RNA, a complete representation of the transcriptome is theoretically present, but in practical terms, insufficient sequence reads are obtained to sufficiently sample all transcripts of all types, and some enrichment strategy is required to reduce extremely abundant rRNA species. (B) Selective rRNA reduction kits use oligonucleotides complementary to ribosomal sequences to specifically reduce the abundance of rRNAs while maintaining a broad representation of transcript species. Since the oligonucleotide probes used in these kits are only designed to bind to and deplete rRNA sequences, a significant amount of unprocessed RNA and gDNA contamination may remain. (C) Poly(A) selection and (D) cDNA capture methods specifically enrich for (primarily) mature polyadenylated RNA species or specific targets (e.g., all known transcript exons), respectively. Since poly(A) selection specifically targets RNAs that have been polyadenylated—a modification that happens at the end of the transcription process—poly(A) selection results in an enrichment for mature, completely processed RNAs. Poly(A) selection and cDNA capture methods sacrifice some transcriptome representation for increased signal to noise for transcripts of greater interest. Poly(A) methods will fail to represent most noncoding and other nonpolyadenylated RNAs. Capture methods on the other hand will under-represent any loci not specifically included in the capture design. For example, in this case the brown gene was not included in the design, and therefore, expression of this gene would be underestimated. Each of the methods depicted here has advantages and disadvantages (S3 Table and S7 Table). Furthermore, the relative amounts of each class of RNA depicted in each panel are hypothetical examples meant to demonstrate the goals and principles of each enrichment strategy and should not be interpreted quantitatively. Refer to S4 Table for additional information on the effect of each enrichment strategy.|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/144/4527835/PMC4527835_pcbi.1004393.g004.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527835|PMC4527835|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527835/bin/pcbi.1004393.g004.jpg

The cytolytic capacity of NKp46-defined NK-cell subsets (CD8α+NKp46-: blue, CD8α+NKp46+: green) isolated from blood was analysed after receptor triggering. Cells were stimulated with rhIL-2 and rpIL-15 overnight. Triggering of NK-receptors was performed by using monoclonal antibodies against NKp46, CD16 or a combination of both. Irrelevant isotype-matched antibody served as negative control. NK-cell receptor mediated degranulation was assessed by measuring the expression of CD107a on the cell surface by four-colour flow cytometry after one hour incubation. CD107a expression was measured on CD3- lymphocytes (not shown), followed by gating on the respective NKp46-defined NK subsets. (A) Numbers indicate the percentage of CD107a+ cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of CD107a within respective NKp46-gates. Results are representative of experiments with five different animals. (B) CD107a expression analyses of five animals analysed. The proportion of CD107a+ cells within the different NKp46-defined subsets is shown in the upper graphs. Percentage of CD107a+ NK cells was calculated by subtracting spontaneous degranulation observed in cultures stimulated with isotype-control antibodies from the frequency of CD107a+ cells in cultures stimulated with NKp46 and/or CD16 mAbs.

There is no detectable SLC45A2 protein expression and tyrosinase expression is reduced in patient cells compared with control cells. Tyrosinase is present in the medium from patient cells, suggesting that this protein is abnormally secreted from these cells; it is also found in the excreted exosome pellet. The media were collected from an equal number of cells and equal volumes of concentrated proteins were loaded onto the gel. Loading was controlled by assessing β-actin expression in the whole cell lysate of the corresponding cells. The western blot with the exosome marker TSG101 demonstrates that exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium.c) Control and patient cells stained for SLC45A2 and the melanosome marker PMEL17, showing co-localization (inserts) of the 2 proteins in control cells. Consistent with the western blot, no staining for SLC45A2 is seen in patient cells but PMEL17 looks comparable to control cells.d) Control and patient cells stained for tyrosinase and PMEL17, show the co-localization (inserts) of the 2 proteins in control cells.

Methods with accurate statistics have their curves follow the dotted line closely over the whole range. Each curve was constructed by aggregating the results of ∼109 GO-based decoy term queries.

In microarray plots for SaddleSum, T-profiler and GAGE, full lines indicate the results where negative weights were set to 0, while dashed lines show the results using all weights. The reason that HGEM curves run below the theoretical line and parallel to it is that every curve is an aggregate of many curves, each of which (i) represents a single sample of weights determining parameters to be fed into hypergeometric distribution, and (ii) is a step function touching the theoretical line and dropping below it.

An enriched population of primary mouse chondrocytes were treated with DMSO vehicle, 1 μM cytochalasin D, 10 μM Y27632 or 50 nM jasplakinolide for 24 hrs. RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE 4.0 chips. Gene lists were compiled from genes that demonstrated a reliable signal (as determined by the MAS5.0 algorithm) and changed significantly; a 1.5-fold cut-off was assigned. (A) Inhibition of Rho/ROCK signalling by Y27632 resulted in 176 probe sets being up-regulated and 139 probe sets being down-regulated. Cytochalasin D treatment resulted in 777 up-regulated and 1209 down-regulated probe sets in comparison to control cultures while jasplakinolide treatment resulted in 120 probe sets being up-regulated and 107 probe sets being down-regulated. (B) Comparisons of all probe sets regulated by the three different pharmacological actin modifiers demonstrate that 14 probe sets are commonly regulated by all treatments.

The mean lifespans are given as percent change in average lifespan vs. untreated control. The y‐axis of all bar graphs shows changes over a 60–140% range. The ratio of the lifespan of untreated worms of the genotype represented in the graph to the lifespan of wild‐type worms treated only with DMSO is given as a number on top of the bar corresponding to untreated worms of the experimental genotype (see Table S1 for all values). Sample sizes are given in the bars. Error bars are SEM. The asterisks indicate P‐values from t‐test comparisons to the controls. For all the bar graphs, *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, and ***P &lt; 0.0001. PQ increases the lifespan gas‐1 (A) despite the fact that these mutants sustain elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress. All three antioxidants strongly increase the survival of sod‐12345 mutants (C–E), suggesting that RSV acts like an antioxidant in C. elegans. A dosage of PQ (0.0125 mm) that is eight times lower than the dosage for optimal lifespan lengthening of the wild‐type (0.1 mm) still significantly shortens the lifespan of sod‐2;sod‐3 double mutants (E), suggesting that these mutants sustain severe mitochondrial oxidative stress. However, the effect of RSV on these mutants is indistinguishable from its effect on the wild‐type (F), thus suggesting that RSV does not act on mitochondria.|graphs|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/23/5242296/PMC5242296_ACEL-16-104-g004.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242296|PMC5242296|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242296/bin/ACEL-16-104-g004.jpg

Real-time PCR analysis of liver tissue from mice (n = 18) revealed altered gene expression for (A) LCN2, (B) CXCL1, and (C) CXCL9, as detected by microarray analysis. Analysis results of the three genes were in directional concordance with microarray results and were statistically significantly upregulated in FLS compared with DS mice (p &lt; 0.05). Differences between the FLS and DS groups were assessed by the Mann–Whitney U-test. (D) Hepatocytes strongly positive for LCN2 were aggregated close to most inflammatory foci, whereas DS mice hepatocytes were scarcely stained. LCN2 protein was also expressed in some mononuclear cells in both types of mice (arrowheads).

A total of 0.05 μM mantdADP were titrated with DDX1 protein in the presence of saturating amounts of 10mer polyA RNA (circles) or 13mer mixed sequence RNA (squares). The dotted line shows the same titration in the absence of RNA (same as Supplementary Figure S2). (B) Competition experiments in the presence of saturating amounts of the same RNA as in (A) are shown and labeled similarly. For the experiments a complex of 0.2 μM mantdADP and 1 μM DDX1 was titrated with ATP in the presence of an ATP-regeneration system. Titration data were fitted as described for Figure 3 and corresponding rate constants are shown in Table 1. (C) Competition experiments with AppNHp in the presence of saturating (40 μM) amounts of 10mer polyA RNA. (D) Competition experiments with AppCH2p in the presence of saturating (40 μM) amounts of 10mer polyA RNA. (E) Titration experiments to determine RNA affinity are shown. Complexes of 1 μM DDX1, 0.2 μM mantdADP and either 50 (circles), 100 (squares), 200 (triangles) or 400 μM (inverted triangles) of ATP were titrated with 10mer polyA RNA. Titrations were performed in the presence of an ATP-regeneration system. Depicted fits were obtained from a global numeric iteration using this and previously measured mantdADP, ATP/AppNHp equilibrium titration data with the program DynaFit (60). The response parameter, i.e. the fluorescence signal of 1 μM DDX1-mantdADP complex was assumed to be constant for all measurements. Affinity constants obtained by global fitting are shown in Table 1. (F) Same experimental setup as in (E), but titrating RNA to 100 (circles), 200 (squares), 400 (triangles), 1000 (inverted triangles) or 3000 μM (diamonds) AppNHp instead of ATP. Notably, the data points for 100 μM AppNHp are not well described by the fit (residuals of up to 20% of signal amplitude), due to variations in the signal amplitude. However, each single fit in the global fit analysis is influenced by all other datasets that are included. Keeping that in mind, overall the fits describe the data points reasonably well (also see errors in Table 1). (G) Minimal binding scheme for binding of ATP or mantdADP to the DDX1 helicase. This scheme was used for global fitting of all ATP or AppNHp titration data to obtain the affinities for RNA, Kd,RNA and Kd(ATP),RNA/Kd(AppNHp),RNA.

830|88013|PMC4678112_gr2.jpg|Mechanisms Of Development|Expression of mouse HoxA and Tetraodon HoxAa genes in either wild type or tni HoxAa mice. In situ hybridization was performed on E11.5 wild type and transgenic embryos (genotypes are indicated on the right hand side). Wild type embryos were analyzed with mouse specific probes to visualize the expression of the endogenous Hoxa genes and with Tetraodon specific probes to exclude potential cross reactivity with the endogenous mouse genes. Tni HoxAa transgenic embryos were processed for Tetraodon specific probes. Probe names are indicated above as well as whether the probe used was for a wild type or transgenic specimen (indicated on the left hand side). The expression pattern of the Tetraodon probes in the transgenic context shows the expected collinear pattern with Hoxa9a being expressed most anteriorly (although not as far as the endogenous mouse Hoxa9) and Hoxa13a restricted to the posterior most tail. There is however marginal differentiation, if any, between the anterior expression limits of Hoxa10a and Hoxa11a. A clear difference is observed in expression between mouse Hoxa11, which has an anterior expression limit close to the posterior limit of the hind limb buds, and the Tetraodon Hoxa11a, that has a limit around three to four somites more anterior, coinciding with the anterior limit of the hind limb buds (the anterior level of axial expression in both wild type and tni HoxAa panels is indicated with a dotted line). This particular area where the difference is observed is the part of the body where sacral transformations are scored (Fig. 1).

Alternatively, T cells remained in the presence of macrophages throughout the entire culture period (white diamonds, bold line).

For example, in case of 16 wells-MMV (16 = 24, N = 4), address-allotting becomes as shown in the center of this figure. If we regard each order (bit) corresponding to a different element (in this case, color), then 4 different (orthogonal) elements need to be prepared. If we take '1' as 'add' and '0' as 'not add', each binary addressing corresponds to directing which elements should be added there. So, the template way (see Fig. 3c) requires 4 different template plates as shown in this figure. By using these four templates, 16 different states can be prepared in an MMV.|microarrays|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/107/2959086/PMC2959086_1472-6750-10-71-5.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2959086|PMC2959086|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2959086/bin/1472-6750-10-71-5.jpg

Mathematical models of spinal  motor neurons (MNs) and interneurons (INs) make up the motor nuclei associated with the Triceps Surae (TS) and Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscles. MNs from the TS motor nuclei receive constant intensity descending commands during the maintenance of upright stance. Proprioceptive feedback is provided by Ia, II and Ib afferents from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs (GTOs). The information carried through these afferents is fed back to the spinal cord representing fundamental pathways (or neuronal circuits) involved in the postural control task, such as Ia monosynaptic excitation, Ib di-synaptic inhibition, group II di-synaptic excitation, and reciprocal inhibition from antagonistic Ia afferents. Activity from Gamma motor neurons (-MNs) set the sensitivities of the muscle spindles. Ankle joint torque () that drives the body biomechanics (to compensate for the gravitational toppling torque) is given by the sum of the torques produced by the muscles () and the passive ankle joint torque, represented by the passive ankle joint stiffness () and viscosity (). The body angle () is the resultant output of the inverted pendulum acted on by gravity and by . It indirectly (by means of Equations 8 and 9) defines moment arms () and musculotendon (MTU) lengths (), which are used to define the dynamics of both MTUs and muscle receptors (see dashed lines). Additionally,  is fed back without delay to account for the intrinsic passive joint impedance (stiffness and viscosity). (B) Hill-type model used to represent the viscoelastic and contractile properties of the MTUs. Muscle fibres are represented by parallel passive elements (muscle fibre stiffness, , and viscosity, ) and two contractile elements (CE) representing the contractile properties of type-I and type-II muscle fibres. A pinnation angle () is adopted to represent the angle between the muscle fibres and the aponeurosis. In addition, a mass () is used to increase the computational stability. Passive properties of tendon and distal aponeurosis are represented by a lumped non-linear stiffness (). Muscle spindle is placed parallel to the muscle fibres, while the GTO is in series with the tendon.

The numerator in equation 3 is calculated as follows: For a particular aberration (shown on the left half of the figure) (A) the PSF is computed from the wavefront error associated with the aberration, (B) the MTF is computed as the Fourier transform of the PSF, (C) the MTF is weighted by a Gaussian function (in log frequency space and with mean equal to an observer's channel center frequency in the control condition) representing the visual channel mediating letter identification and (D) the result (green shaded area) is then additionally weighted by a notch filter that removes the spatial frequencies masked by the passband of noise. The result of this additional weighting (red shaded area) is then summed. The denominator in equation 3 is calculated by repeating steps (A–D) for a diffraction-limited PSF, as shown on the right half of the figure. The visual Strehl ratio is then the sum for the aberration divided by the sum for the diffraction-limited case and the result is weighted by the total signal power in the notch filter. A similar calculation is performed for the VScombined (see Equation 4) except that in the numerator the MTF is weighted by the PTF, normalized between zero (at a phase shift of π) and one (at a phase shift of zero) and in the denominator the diffraction-limited MTF is replaced by the MTF for the aberration (Young et al., 2013a).|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/79/4179702/PMC4179702_fpsyg-05-01060-g0005.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179702|PMC4179702|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179702/bin/fpsyg-05-01060-g0005.jpg

The three laminin subunits (A/α1, B1/β, and B2/γ) were described some time ago; A/α2 more recently (see Table S6 for details). All are homologous with vertebrate laminins and it is notable that C. elegans has a very similar complement of four laminin subunits (Hutter et al. 2000). The set of three conserved collagen genes (two α IV subunits and one αXV/XVIII homologue) is also replicated in C. elegans. In D. melanogaster, the two type IV collagen genes (CT12803 and CT25584) are linked in head-to-head organization as are all three type IV collagen pairs in vertebrates. The two type IV collagen genes in C. elegans are not linked. Several other genes in D. melanogaster contain short collagen segments but there are no fibrillar collagens with long collagen triple helices. The D. melanogaster homologues of nidogen/entactin (CT32053) and perlecan (CT23996) have similar domain compositions (see this figure and Table S6) as their homologues in C. elegans and vertebrates, although the numbers of repeats vary among phyla.

Mixing time (τm) = 400 ms. EXSY-correlation intensities between GSH and HMG are increased in the presence of GFA. (B) 1D EXSY spectra of equilibrium mixtures of GSH (initial concentration 15 mM) and HMG in the presence of GFA (20 μM) conducted at different mixing times (τm = 32–300 ms). Irradiation (inversion) of a β-cysteinyl resonance of HMG (δH 2.95 ppm) induced an exchange correlation at δH 2.87 ppm, corresponding to the β-cysteinyl resonance of GSH, which increased in intensity at longer mixing times. (C) Graph showing the intensity of the GSH cross-peak relative to the inverted HMG resonance in the absence and presence of GFA at different mixing times, using either NOESY or ROESY pulse sequences. τm = 4–400 ms. (D) Bar graph showing the intensity of the GSH 1D EXSY-correlation relative to the irradiated HMG resonance in the absence (blue) and presence (green) of GFA (τm = 80 ms). The build-up rates of the 1D EXSY analyses (note: a τm of 80 ms is within the linear range of the EXSY build-up curves, Fig 2C) correlate with the rates of GSH/HMG exchange at equilibrium. Therefore, the observed increase in correlation intensity in the presence of GFA implies an increase in GSH/HMG inter-conversion rate. (E) Non-denaturing MS analyses of GSH binding to GFA. Two new peaks corresponding to the masses of monomeric GFA (with two zinc ions in complex) bound to one and two GSH molecules respectively were observed upon incubation with GSH (4 equivalents, right). (F) Binding curve of GSH binding to GFA obtained using waterLOGSY. Selective irradiation of the solvent H2O 1H resonance results in magnetisation transfer to GSH, resulting in the emergence of GSH 1H resonances with opposite sign to the irradiated H2O resonance. The (negative) intensities of the GSH resonances are linearly dependent on the GSH concentration (blue). Addition of GFA results in a slower net tumbling rate for GSH in solution due to binding with GFA. The slower tumbling rate leads to ‘(more) positive’ GSH resonance intensities as a function of the extent of ligand binding (green). Subtraction of the intensities in the absence (blue) and presence (green) of GFA gives a normalised binding curve (orange, KD value of roughly 500 μM assuming binding of one GSH molecule per GFA subunit). The experiments were carried out at 280 K. τm = 1 s.

As a result, assembly of the ODA is restored in these strains (as shown by antibodies detecting the IC2 subunit of the ODA). Notably, the DC1 protein in the D-transformants migrates as a larger protein, which indicates that this integration event results in expression of a chimeric protein. In contrast, the E1-4 transformant is not rescued for ODA and ODA-DC assembly (as shown by much less DC1 or IC2 detected in the axonemes), which is consistent with the failure to restore wild-type swimming in this strain. Bottom panel: a gel of the same samples was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) as a loading control. (B) Electron microscopy demonstrates that the ODAs (arrows in top and bottom panels) assemble with normal periodicity on all eight outer doublet microtubules in wild type (WT) and the D-transformant (D12-8).

The mass isotopomer distributions of striped metabolites are assumed to be measured. Fragments M1/E and M2 belong to the same fragment equivalence class. Thus, Dm(M1/E) can be derived from Dm(M2) by the measurement propagation inside equivalence classes. Furthermore, fragments M5/E' and M5/F' dominate fragments M1/E and M1/F, and the bond between M1/E and M1/F is broken in all pathways producing M1 from M5. Thus, M1/E and M1/F are statistically independent, and Dm(M1/F) can be deduced from Dm(M1) and Dm(M1/E) by utilizing Equation 7. Computed Dm(M1/F) can then be propagated to M4, as M1 and M4 belong to the same fragment equivalence class. Finally, Dm(M4) helps to solve the ratios of fluxes entering to M3.|others-openset|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/254/2430715/PMC2430715_1471-2105-9-266-7.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430715|PMC2430715|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430715/bin/1471-2105-9-266-7.jpg

Both EB and LB made the clicks in the presence of a position marker (shown in 1B) located straight ahead. Spectrograms were obtained using an FFT window of 256 samples, corresponding to approximately 5.6 ms in our recordings. Waveform plots and spectrograms are for illustration. While the exact properties of the click and its echo (e.g. loudness, timbre) are specific to the person generating the click as well as the sound reflecting surface, prominent characteristics of clicks are short duration (approximately 10 ms) and broad frequency spectra, both of which are evident in the plots. B: Position marker used for angular position discrimination experiments during active echolocation, and to make recordings for the passive listening paradigm. The marker was an aluminium foil covered foam half-tube (diameter 6 cm, height 180 cm), placed vertically, at a distance of 150 cm, with the concave side facing the subject. Note the 125-Hz cutoff wedge system on the walls of the anechoic chamber.

Then the depression recovers slowly toward 1. Usually the noise is able to produce a transition, before full recovery is achieved.Bottom graph: Histogram of the population voltage: fraction of the time spent in a given state. Units are in ms on the y-axis and in mV on the x-axis: the fraction of total time spent in the Up and Down state is about the same during the 20 s of simulations. The maximum time in the Up state is about 500 ms but the mean maximum time is about 3 s.Right column graph of (A): histogram of the duration of the Up states.(B) Effect of an external stimulation: depolarization. When a constant external input (I = 0.8) is added into the model, the neural network spends on average more time in the Up state than in Down state. In that case, the attractor point P1 is shifted and is now closer to the separatrix.(C) Hyperpolarization, simulated by a current injection. A hyperpolarization (I = −0.3) drives the ensemble of neurons at a lower mean potential, and as a result the neural network spends on average more time in the Down state.|graphs|https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/298/1409813/PMC1409813_pcbi.0020023.g002.png|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1409813|PMC1409813|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1409813/bin/pcbi.0020023.g002.jpg
