Few literatures have explored the association between NSCLC development and lncRNAs expression. This study focuses on the important role of a novel lncRNA TRPM2-AS in the development of chemo-resistance in NSCLC.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe expression level of lncRNA TRPM2-AS was identified by using qRT-PCR assay. The apoptosis rate and the alteration of the cell cycle were detected by the flow cytometric analysis. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay (CCK8) was utilized for detecting chemo-sensitivity of the cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells. The p53 and p66shc protein levels were detected by Western blotting assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA549/DDP cells presented remarkably higher expression of lncRNA TRPM2-AS than paired A549 cells. Moreover, re-sensitization to cisplatin was seen in A549/DDP cells after lncRNA TRPM2-AS knockdown. On the contrary, the sensitivity of lncRNA TRPM2-AS-overexpressed A549 cells to cisplatin decreased obviously when compared with the control. Furthermore, downregulated lncRNA TRPM2-AS induced cell apoptosis and altered cell cycle distribution through activating the p53-p66shc pathway.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe suggest that lncRNA TRPM2-AS participates in the resistance of NSCLC cells to cisplatin, which may provide a new therapeutic target of NSCLC.", "url": null, "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/28678322/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2017-07-06", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

In our research, we aim to uncover the molecular functions of miR-532-5p in glioma development.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect miR-532-5p expression in 48 glioma samples and 4 glioma cell lines. The Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine the association of miR-532-5p expression with several clinicopathological indexes in glioma patients. Besides, cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, and Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay were performed to explore in vitro effects of miR-532-5p on glioma cells. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-532-5p and CSF1 in glioma was studied by performing Western blot assay and Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDownregulated miR-532-5p expression was observed in glioma tissues compared with adjacent normal samples. MiR-532-5p expression was associated with the KPS score and tumor grading in glioma patients. Moreover, cell proliferation of glioma was inhibited after overexpression of miR-532-5p in vitro. Furthermore, CSF1 was a target of miR-532-5p in glioma. After overexpression of miR-532-5p, CSF1 was downregulated at mRNA and protein levels in vitro Besides, the expression of CSF1 in glioma tissues was negatively related to that of miR-532-5p.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMalignant phenotypes of glioma cells were remarkably suppressed through the overexpression of miR-532-5p.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common type of fatal cancer worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the specific function of lncRNA OR3A4 in the progression of NSCLC, and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nLncRNA OR3A4 expression in 52-paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation assay and cell apoptosis assay were used to investigate the function of OR3A4 in NSCLC. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored by qRT-PCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOR3A4 expression was remarkably upregulated in NSCLC tissues when compared with adjacent normal tissues. The overall survival of NSCLC patients in high OR3A4 expression group was significantly worse than those in low OR3A4 expression group. After the silence of OR3A4, the proliferation of NSCLC cells was significantly inhibited. Besides, the apoptosis of NSCLC cells was remarkably promoted after the silence of OR3A4. Meanwhile, knockdown of OR3A4 significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of SOX4 in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the expression of SOX4 was found upregulated in both NSCLC tissues and cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese above results suggested that OR3A4 could promote cell proliferation and suppress cell apoptosis in NSCLC through up-regulating SOX4.

Recent studies have identified the vital role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development and progression of BC. In this investigation, lncRNA TTN-AS1 was studied to identify its function in the metastasis of BC. TTN-AS1 expression of tissues was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 56 BC patients. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to observe the biological behavior changes of BC cells through gain or loss of TTN-AS1. In addition, luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed to discover the potential targets of TTN-AS1 in BC cells. TTN-AS1 expression level in BC samples was higher than that of adjacent tissue. Besides, the ability of cell migration and invasion of BC cells was inhibited after TTN-AS1 was silenced, while cell migration and cell invasion of BC cells were promoted after TTN-AS1 was overexpressed. In addition, miR-140-5p was upregulated after silencing of TTN-AS1 in BC cells, while miR-140-5p was downregulated after overexpression of TTN-AS1 in BC cells. Furthermore, luciferase assays and RIP assay showed that miR-140-5p was a direct target of TTN-AS1 in BC.

The circ-SMAD7 expression level and the patients' overall survival time were analyzed. Functional experiments were conducted to identify the changes of the biological behaviors in CRC cells after the overexpression of circ-SMAD7. The transwell assay, the Matrigel assay, and the Wound healing assay were conducted. The Western blot assay was performed to analyze the effect of circ-SMAD7 on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Results In the research, the expression level of circ-SMAD7 was significantly decreased in CRC tissues compared with that in the adjacent samples. Circ-SMAD7 expression was positively associated to patients' overall survival time. The expression of circ-SMAD7 was also decreased in CRC cell lines. The upregulation of circ-SMAD7 led to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion in CRC. In addition, the results of further experiments revealed that the EMT-related proteins were regulated via overexpression of circ-SMAD7 in CRC.

The aim of this study was to investigate the exact role of lncRNA MIAT in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nMIAT expression in NSCLC tissue samples was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The association between the expression of MIAT and the prognosis of NSCLC patients were explored. Furthermore, the wound healing assay and the transwell assay were conducted in vitro. In addition, the luciferase assay and the RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) were used to elucidate the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe MIAT expression in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher than that of the corresponding normal tissues. Meanwhile, the MIAT expression was associated with the overall survival time of NSCLC patients. The migration and invasion of cells were significantly promoted after MIAT was over-expressed in vitro. Meanwhile, the cell migration and cell invasion were obviously remarkedly inhibited after MIAT knock-down in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that microRNA-1246 (miR-1246) was as a novel target for MIAT. The expression of miR-1246 was significantly down-regulated or up-regulated after the overexpression or down-expression of MIAT, respectively. Further mechanism assays showed that miR-1246 was a direct target of MIAT in NSCLC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMIAT enhanced the NSCLC cell migration and invasion via targeting miR-1246, which might be a potential biomarker in NSCLC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18318", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201907_18318/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-07-13", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to exert pivotal functions in tumorigenesis. In this research, lncRNA SNHG14 was studied to identify its role in the metastasis of ovarian cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nSNHG14 expression was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) in ovarian cancer specimens. Functional assays including wound healing assay, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were performed to detect the effect of SNHG14 on the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further explored through qRT-PCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNHG14 level was dramatically higher in ovarian cancer specimens. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were significantly attenuated via the inhibition of SNHG14, while enhanced via the SNHG14 overexpression. Besides, the expression of DGCR8 mRNA and protein was markedly downregulated after the knockdown of SNHG14, while upregulated after SNHG14 overexpression. Furthermore, the expression level of DGCR8 was increased in cancer tissues and positively related to the expression of SNHG14 in ovarian cancer tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, SNHG14 could enhance cell migration and invasion via upregulating DGCR8 in ovarian cancer.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19659", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201912_19659/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": null, "publishedDate": "2019-12-17", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Furthermore, the regulatory effects of NEAT1 on the proliferation and metastasis of laryngocarcinoma cells were evaluated. Biological role of NEAT1/miR-29a-3p axis was finally explored in regulating the progression of laryngocarcinoma.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNEAT1 was upregulated in laryngocarcinoma tissues and cell lines. NEAT1 knockdown suppressed growth and invasive abilities in laryngocarcinoma cells, while overexpression of NEAT1 enhanced such abilities. Further experiments showed that miR-29a-3p was directly targeted by NEAT1, and participated in NEAT-mediated progression of laryngocarcinoma.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNEAT1 is a novel oncogene in laryngocarcinoma and could enhance growth and invasion of laryngocarcinoma cells by targeting miR-29a-3p.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18442", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201907_18442/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-08-01", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Moreover, CASC15 downregulated the miR-130b-3p expression and promoted cell migration and invasion in BLCA in vitro. The rescue experiments also revealed that the inhibitory effects by the silence of CASC15 could be reversed through the inhibition of miR-130b-3p.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggested a vital regulatory mechanism of CASC15 in BLCA, and the CASC15/miR-130b-3p axis might serve as a new therapeutic interventional target for BLCA patients.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19544", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201911_19544/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-12-05", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

RNAs (lncRNAs) act as an important role in many diseases. In this research, lncRNA PROX1-AS1 was explored to identify how it functioned in the development of prostate cancer (PC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect PROX1-AS1 expression in PC patients. Then, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were performed to identify its function in PC cells. Furthermore, the potential mechanism was also explored using mechanism assays.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPROX1-AS1 expression level was significantly higher in PC tissue samples and cell lines. Results of MTT assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay showed that cell proliferation and invasion were inhibited through the silence of PROX1-AS1 in PC cells, while cell proliferation and invasion were promoted through the overexpression of PROX1-AS1 in PC cells. Furthermore, the expression of miR-647 was upregulated via the silence of PROX1-AS1 in PC cells, while the expression of miR-647 was downregulated via the overexpression of PROX1-AS1 in PC cells. Further mechanism assays showed that miR-647 was a direct target of PROX1-AS1 in PC. Correlation analysis showed that miR-647 expression was negatively correlated with PROX1-AS1 expression in PC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults above suggested that PROX1-AS1 could enhance cell proliferation and invasion of PC cells by sponging miR-647 and might be applied as a novel target for the treatment of PC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20658", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202003_20658/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-04-10", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. This study aims to explore the role of lncRNA ROR1-AS1 in the metastasis of NPC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to measure ROR1-AS1 expression in 50 NPC tissues. The function assays including wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted to detect the behavior changes of NPC cells after the knockdown of ROR1-AS1, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of NPC metastasis was further measured by performing the Western blot assay in vitro. Besides, the target miRNAs were also explored by luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP).\n\n\nRESULTS\nROR1-AS1 expression level was significantly higher in NPC samples compared with that in adjacent tissues. The knockdown of ROR1-AS1 reduced cell migration and cell invasion of NPC cells, which was identified to inhibit the EMT process of NPC. Furthermore, it was discovered that miR-375 was upregulated via knockdown of ROR1-AS1 and further mechanism assays showed that ROR1-AS1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-375 in NPC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that ROR1-AS1 could act as a sponge for miR-375 and promote cell migration and invasion by inducing EMT process in NPC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19909", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202001_19909/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-01-21", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recently, researches have suggested the important role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the progression of tumorigenesis. This study aims to identify how lncRNA OR3A4 functions in the development of CRC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOR3A4 expressions in 54 paired CRC tissues and CRC cell lines were detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the in vitro functions of OR3A4 in CRC cells were identified by performing proliferation assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. Besides, the underlying mechanism of OR3A4 in CRC development was explored through Western blot and RT-qPCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOR3A4 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than adjacent normal ones. Cell proliferation, migration, and CRC were inhibited after OR3A4 was knocked down in vitro, which were promoted after upregulation of OR3A4.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is diagnosed prevalently in the world. Our study aims to uncover the potential functions of hsa_circ_0011946 in OSCC development.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the level of hsa_circ_0011946 in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Hsa_circ_0011946 was knocked down in OSCC cells. Biological functions of hsa_circ_0011946 in OSCC were identified by performing cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. The underlying mechanism of hsa_circ_0011946 in regulating OSCC progression was explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHsa_circ_0011946 was highly expressed in OSCC tissues compared with adjacent samples. It was also upregulated in OSCC cell lines. The knockdown of hsa_circ_0011946 inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion in OSCC. The expression of PCNA was reduced via knockdown of hsa_circ_0011946.

Recent studies have discovered many oncogenes play vital roles in the tumorigenesis of malignant tumors. The purpose of our study was to uncover the role of GBP1 in NSCLC and the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nGBP1 expression in NSCLC samples was detected by Real Time quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Function assays were performed in NSCLC cells transfected with GBP1 shRNA. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were conducted to explore the target signaling pathway of GBP1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGBP1 expression was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissue samples compared with adjacent normal tissues. Function assays showed that the proliferation of NSCLC cells was significantly inhibited via knockdown of GBP1, while cell apoptosis was promoted. Resistance to paclitaxel was reversed after GBP1 knockdown in paclitaxel resistance A549 cells (A549/Taxol). In addition, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was repressed via knockdown of GBP1 in NSCLC cells and A549/Taxol cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn our study, GBP1 was firstly identified as a novel oncogene in NSCLC.

The role of long noncoding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) in tumor progression has caught the attention of numerous researchers. In this work, lncRNA LINP1 was studied to identify how it functioned in the progression of ovarian cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFirstly, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to measure LINP1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. Furthermore, to identify the function of LINP1 in ovarian cancer, functional experiments were conducted. Also, by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay, the underlying mechanism was explored.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this research, LINP1 expression was remarkably higher in ovarian carcinoma samples compared with adjacent tissues. Moreover, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited after LINP1 was silenced in the ovarian cancer cells. Besides, the messenger (mRNA) and the protein of KLF6 were overexpressed after LINP1 was silenced. Furthermore, the KLF6 expression level was negatively related to the LINP1 expression level in ovarian cancer samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe discovered a potential oncogene in ovarian cancer and identified that LINP1 enhanced cell metastasis and proliferation via down-regulating KLF6.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19893", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202001_19893/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-01-21", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Furthermore, the expression of FUS was remarkably down-regulated after knockdown of circRNA_0000285. Subsequent results indicated that the expression level of FUS was positively correlated with the expression of circRNA_0000285 in CC tissues. In addition, the knockdown of circRNA_0000285 significantly inhibited the formation and metastasis of CC in nude mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCircRNA_0000285 could enhance the proliferation and metastasis of CC by up-regulating FUS, which might be a potential therapeutic target for CC treatment.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19271", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201910_19271/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-11-07", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recent studies have identified the vital role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development and progression of BC. In this research, lncRNA SNHG14 was studied to identify how it functioned in the development and metastasis of BC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nSNHG14 expression of tissues was detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) in 50 paired patients with BC. And cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were enrolled to observe the biological behavior changes of BC cells through gain or loss of SNHG14. In addition, luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) were performed to discover the potential targets of SNHG14 in BC cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSNHG14 expression level of BC samples was higher than that of adjacent ones. Besides, cell growth ability and cell invaded ability of BC cells were inhibited after SNHG14 was silenced, while cell growth ability and cell invaded ability of BC cells were promoted after SNHG14 was overexpressed. In addition, miR-193a-3p was upregulated after silence of SNHG14 in BC cells, while miR-193a-3p was downregulated after overexpression of SNHG14 in BC cells.

Besides, the expression of IGF2 was positively correlated to the expression of HOXA-AS2 in NSCLC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, HOXA-AS2 could enhance migratory and invasive abilities of NSCLC cells by upregulating IGF2, which might offer a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18064", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201906_18064/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-06-19", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as important regulators in progression of tumorigenesis.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect SNHG7 expression in paired NPC patient tissue samples and cell lines. The role of SNHG7 in the metastasis of NPC was detected through scratch wound assay and Transwell assay. RT-qPCR and western blot assay were used to discover the function of SNHG7 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Tumor metastasis assay was also performed in vivo. In this study, RT-qPCR results showed that SNHG7 expression in NPC samples was remarkably higher when compared with that in adjacent ones. Cell invasion and cell migration of NPC were inhibited due to silence of SNHG7 and were promoted due to overexpression of SNHG7. Moreover, results of further experiments revealed that the EMT-related proteins were regulated via knockdown or overexpression of SNHG7 in NPC.

The aim of this study was to explore the exact role of lncRNA AK027294 in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to investigate the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect the AK027294 expression in NSCLC patients. Then, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay were performed, respectively. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were used to explore the potential mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of AK027294 NSCLC samples was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues. Subsequent functional assays showed that the growth ability of NSCLC cells was markedly inhibited after AK027294 silence. In addition, after AK027294 knock-down, the expression of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) was remarkably down-regulated. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the STAT3 expression was positively correlated with the AK027294 expression in NSCLC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe above results indicated that AK027294 could enhance the growth ability of NSCLC by up-regulating STAT3.

"OBJECTIVE\nRecently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted much attention for their roles in tumor progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the exact role of lncRNA UCA1 in the development of thyroid cancer (TC) and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nUCA1 expression in both TC cells and tissues was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Colony formation assay, cell proliferation, and transwell assay were conducted in vitro. Subsequent luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to investigate the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the function of UCA1 in vivo was monitored as well.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUCA1 expression level in TC samples was significantly higher than that of corresponding normal tissues. After UCA1 was knocked down in vitro and in vivo, the proliferation, migration, and invasion of TC cells were significantly inhibited. Moreover, the expression of miR-497-3p was repressed after the knockdown of UCA1. Furthermore, miR-497-3p was directly targeted by UCA1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nKnockdown of UCA1 could inhibit TC cell proliferation and metastasis via sponging miR-497-3p.

In this research, lncRNA TUG1 was explored to identify the role it played in the development of prostate cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nQuantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect TUG1 expression in both prostate cancer tissue samples and cells. Moreover, the associations between expression level of TUG1 and patients' disease-free survival rate were studied respectively. Next, wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn comparison with TUG1 expression in adjacent tissues, TUG1 expression level was significantly higher in prostate cancer samples, which was closely associated with patients' disease-free survival time. After TUG1 was downregulated, cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells were inhibited in vitro. Moreover, after TUG1 was upregulated, cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells were enhanced in vitro. In addition, after knockdown of TUG1, the mRNA and protein expression of DGCR8 was downregulated, while after overexpression of TUG1, the mRNA and protein expression of DGCR8 was upregulated. Furthermore, it was found that DGCR8 expression positively correlated to TUG1 expression in prostate cancer tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults above showed that TUG1 could enhance cell migration and invasion of prostate cancer by upregulating DGCR8, which may offer a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/17385", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201903_17385/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-04-10", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

RNA (lncRNAs) in tumor progression has attracted much attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA SNHG16 in the development of Wilms' tumor, and to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect SNHG16 expression in Wilms' tumor patients' tissues. Function assays, including wound healing assay, and transwell assay, were conducted to detect the changes of biological behaviors in Wilms' tumor cells due to gain or loss of SNHG16. Besides, the luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of SNHG16 was significantly up-regulated in Wilms' tumor tissues when compared with adjacent tissues. Cell migration and invasion abilities were significantly repressed via down-regulation of SNHG16. However, opposite results were obtained after up-regulation of SNHG16 in vitro. After the down-regulation of SNHG16, the expression of miR-200a-3p increased significantly. However, the expression of miR-200a-3p was remarkably reduced via up-regulation of SNHG16 in vitro. Furthermore, SNHG16 acted as a competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-200a-3p in Wilms' tumor.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSNHG16 induced the metastasis of Wilms' tumor via sponging miR-200a-3p.

Functional experiments were conducted to identify the changes of biological behaviors in CRC cells after knockdown of ROR1-AS1. Moreover, we also explored the underlying mechanism. Detection of ROR1-AS1 expression level in patients\u2019 tissues showed that ROR1-AS1 was higher in CRC tissues than that in adjacent ones. ROR1-AS1 expression was negatively associated with patients\u2019 overall survival time. Cell growth ability was inhibited due to knockdown of ROR1-AS1 in vitro. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were repressed after ROR1-AS1 knockdown. Furthermore, due to knockdown of ROR1-AS1, the targeted proteins in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were suppressed.

Circ-SMAD7 shRNA was constructed and transfected into the ovarian cancer cells. To identify the function of circ-SMAD7 in ovarian cancer, cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were conducted, respectively. In addition, qRT-PCR and Western blot assays were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism and, then, it was analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCirc-SMAD7 expression was remarkably higher in ovarian cancer tissue samples than in corresponding normal tissues. The proliferation of the ovarian cancer cells was significantly inhibited after circ-SMAD7 downregulation. Meanwhile, the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells were significantly inhibited after circ-SMAD7 downregulation in vitro. Both the mRNA and the protein expressions of the Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) were remarkably promoted after circ-SMAD7 was knocked down in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the KLF6 expression level was negatively correlated with circ-SMAD7 expression level in ovarian cancer samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that circ-SMAD7 promotes the progression of ovarian cancer and enhances cell metastasis and proliferation via suppressing KLF6.

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the common types of malignancies worldwide. This study aimed to identify the exact function of lncRNA LINP1 in the progression of GC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nLINP1 expression in paired cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues of GC patients was detected by Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). The effect of LINP1 silence on proliferation and apoptosis of GC cells was detected. Meanwhile, the underlying mechanism of LINP1 function was explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. Furthermore, tumor formation assay was performed to examine the ability of LINP1 in tumor formation in vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLINP1 expression was remarkably up-regulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The growth ability of GC cells was significantly inhibited after silencing of LINP1 in vitro. Besides, the apoptosis of GC cells was markedly induced after silencing of LINP1. The silence of LINP1 significantly up-regulated the expression of RBM5 in GC cells. Meanwhile, RBM5 expression in GC tissues was remarkably lower than that of the adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, tumor formation assay showed that knockdown of LINP1 markedly inhibited tumor formation in vivo.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggested that LINP1 could down-regulate RBM5. Meanwhile, LINP1 remarkably promoted growth ability and suppressed apoptosis of GC in vitro and in vivo.

In this research, lncRNA linc-ITGB1 was studied to identify whether it affects the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the linc-ITGB1 expression of CRC cells and tissues. Moreover, the associations between linc-ITGB1 expression level and patients' overall survival rate were further analyzed. Furthermore, we conducted function assays, including wound healing assay and transwell assay, to explore the effect of linc-ITGB1 on CRC metastasis in vitro. In addition, the underlying mechanism was further studied. RESULTS: RT-qPCR results showed that linc-ITGB1 expression level was higher in CRC samples than that in adjacent tissues. Linc-ITGB1 expression was related closely to patients' overall survival time. Moreover, cell migration and cell invasion were inhibited after linc-ITGB1 was silenced in vitro. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of BDNF was downregulated by the silence of linc-ITGB1. Furthermore, the expression level of BDNF was higher in CRC samples than that in adjacent tissues and was positively related to the expression of linc-ITGB. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that linc-ITGB1 could enhance CRC cell migration and invasion via upregulating BDNF.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA ZFPM2 antisense RNA 1 (ZFPM2-AS1) in the progression of renal cell cancer (RCC), and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nExpression levels of ZFPM2-AS1 in both RCC cells and 50 paired tissue samples were detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the relationship between lncRNA ZFPM2-AS1 expression level and clinic-pathological characteristics as well as patients' disease-free survival rate was explored, respectively. Furthermore, cell proliferation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to investigate the role of lncRNA ZFPM2-AS1 in vitro. In addition, Western blot assay, Luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of ZFPM2-AS1 in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that of corresponding normal tissues. ZFPM2-AS1 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis, tumor stage and survival time of RCC patients. Moreover, the overexpression of ZFPM2-AS1 significantly promoted the growth, invasion and migration of tumor cells, whereas remarkably inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro. Further experiments revealed that miR-137 was a direct target of ZFPM2-AS1. In addition, miR-137 expression in tumor tissues was negatively correlated with ZFPM2-AS1 expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings indicated that ZFPM2-AS1 could promote metastasis and proliferation, whereas inhibiting the apoptosis of RCC via targeting miR-137.

Function assays were conducted to detect the effect of DLX6-AS1 on the proliferation and metastasis of CRC in vitro. Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) were used to explore the underlying mechanism of DLX6-AS1.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDLX6-AS1 expression in CRC samples was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues. Loss of DLX6-AS1 markedly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay and RIP assay showed that DLX6-AS1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-577 in CRC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDLX6-AS1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC by sponging miR-577, which might offer a potential therapeutic target for CRC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/17800", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201905_17800/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-05-23", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

ROR1-AS1 expression level and patients' overall survival time were analyzed. Functional experiments were conducted to identify the changes of biological behaviors in CRC cells after knockdown of ROR1-AS1. Moreover, we also explored the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDetection of ROR1-AS1 expression level in patients' tissues showed that ROR1-AS1 was higher in CRC tissues than that in adjacent ones. ROR1-AS1 expression was negatively associated with patients' overall survival time. Cell growth ability was inhibited due to knockdown of ROR1-AS1 in vitro. Moreover, cell migration and invasion abilities were repressed after ROR1-AS1 was knockdown. Furthermore, due to the knockdown of ROR1-AS1, the targeted proteins in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were suppressed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggested that ROR1-AS1 could enhance cell metastasis and proliferation via inducing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which might offer a potential therapeutic target in CRC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18650", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201908_18650/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-08-08", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. Hsa_circ_0000285 was explored to identify how it functions in the metastasis of HCC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect hsa_circ_0000285 expression in HCC patients' tissues. Hsa_circ_0000285 lentivirus and shRNA was constructed for the transfection of HCC cells. Wound healing assay, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were conducted to identify the function of hsa_circ_0000285 in HCC cells. Furthermore, mechanism assays were performed to uncover the interaction between hsa_circ_0000285 and miR-599.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHsa_circ_0000285 was significantly higher-expressed in HCC samples compared to that in adjacent samples. The migrated length of HCC cells was reduced after hsa_circ_0000285 was silenced, while the migrated length of HCC cells was increased after hsa_circ_0000285 was overexpressed. Moreover, the number of migrated and invaded HCC cells was reduced after hsa_circ_0000285 was silenced, while the number of migrated and invaded HCC cells was increased after hsa_circ_0000285 was overexpressed. Moreover, RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-599 was downregulated via overexpression of hsa_circ_0000285, while miR-599 was upregulated via knockdown of hsa_circ_0000285. Further experiments showed that miR-599 was a direct target of hsa_circ_0000285 in HCC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHsa_circ_0000285 could enhance cell metastasis of HCC by targeting miR-599 and might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20819", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202004_20819/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-04-25", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

In this research, lncRNA ROR1-AS1 was explored to identify its role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to measure ROR1-AS1 expression of CRC tissues. Besides, function assays including wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted to detect the effect of ROR1-AS1 on the metastasis of CRC. Furthermore, Luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP) were used to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBy comparison with ROR1-AS1 expression in adjacent tissues, the ROR1-AS1 expression level was significantly higher in CRC samples. Moreover, loss of ROR1-AS1 inhibited cell migration and cell invasion of CRC cells. Besides, gain of ROR1-AS1 enhanced cell migration and cell invasion of CRC cells. Furthermore, it was found that ROR1-AS1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-375 in CRC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present study suggests that ROR1-AS1 could promote cell migration and invasion of CRC by sponging miR-375, which may offer a potential therapeutic target in CRC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18729", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201908_18729/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-09-06", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Furthermore, the interaction between hsa_circ_0000285 and miR-599 in TC cells was uncovered by the Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHsa_circ_0000285 level was significantly higher in TC samples than that in adjacent samples. Migration and invasion of TC cells were reduced after silence of hsa_circ_0000285, while their metastatic abilities were enhanced by overexpression of hsa_circ_0000285. Moreover, RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-599 was downregulated via overexpression of hsa_circ_0000285, while miR-599 was upregulated via knockdown of hsa_circ_0000285. Furthermore, the Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-599 was directly targeted by hsa_circ_0000285 in TC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHsa_circ_0000285 could enhance cell metastasis of TC by targeting miR-599.

The aim of this study was to investigate the exact role of lncRNA OR3A4 in the development of ovarian cancer (OC), and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOR3A4 expression in OC tissue samples was detected by Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate the effect of OR3A4 on the metastasis of OC. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of OR3A4 in OC samples was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were significantly repressed after OR3A4 knockdown in vitro. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expressions of kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) were remarkably upregulated after knockdown of OR3A4. Furthermore, the expression level of KLF6 was negatively correlated with the expression of OR3A4 in OC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results showed that OR3A4 could enhance OC cell metastasis and invasion via suppressing KLF6. Moreover, OR3A4 might be a potential therapeutic target for OC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/17380", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201903_17380/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-04-10", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

In our investigation, lncRNA PCAT-1 was studied to identify how it functioned in the progression of ovarian cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nLncRNA PCAT-1 expression was detected by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in both ovarian cancer cells and tissue samples. Furthermore, to identify the function of PCAT-1 in ovarian cancer, cell proliferation, transwell assay and Matrigel assay were conducted. In addition, by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay, the underlying mechanism was explored.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPCAT-1 expression was remarkably higher in ovarian cancer samples when compared with that in corresponding ones. Moreover, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were inhibited after PCAT-1 was knocked down in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of KLF6 (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 6) was upregulated after PCAT-1 was knocked down. Furthermore, the KLF6 expression level was negatively related to the PCAT-1 expression level in ovarian cancer samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe showed that PCAT-1 promotes the progression of ovarian cancer through enhancing cell metastasis and proliferation via suppressing KLF6, which might be a novel therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18044", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201906_18044/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-06-19", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

In this work, we aimed to explore whether lncRNA linc-ITGB1 affected the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS Linc-ITGB1 expression in both ccRCC cells and tissue samples was detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the association between linc-ITGB1 expression level and patients' disease-free survival rate was explored. Then, wound healing and transwell assays were conducted. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored through RT-qPCR and Western blot assay. RESULTS Linc-ITGB1 expression level in ccRCC samples was markedly higher than that of the adjacent ones. The expression of linc-ITGB1 was closely related to the disease-free survival time of ccRCC patients. Moreover, the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells were remarkably enhanced after linc-ITGB1 upregulation in vitro. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of Mcl-1 were significantly downregulated after linc-ITGB1 overexpression. Furthermore, the expression level of Mcl-1 was negatively correlated with the linc-ITGB1 expression in ccRCC tissues. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggested that linc-ITGB1 could enhance ccRCC cell migration and invasion via downregulating Mcl-1. In addition, linc-ITGB1 might be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/17238", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201903_17238/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": null, "publishedDate": "2019-03-28", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Thyroid cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of circ-ABCB10 in thyroid cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nCirc-ABCB10 expression in 40 paired thyroid cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues was monitored by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Subsequently, circ-ABCB10 was silenced or overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells. Function assays were conducted to explore the role of circ-ABCB10 in the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer in vitro. Furthermore, RT-qPCR and Western blot assay were performed to elucidate the potential underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCirc-ABCB10 expression was significantly higher in thyroid cancer tissues than that in adjacent tissues. The growth ability of thyroid cancer cells was significantly inhibited after circ-ABCB10 silence. However, the growth ability of thyroid cancer cells was remarkably promoted after circ-ABCB10 was overexpressed in vitro. Similarly, the invasion of thyroid cancer cells was significantly inhibited or promoted after circ-ABCB10 silence or overexpression, respectively. Besides, the expression of KLF6 was markedly up-regulated by the silence of circ-ABCB10. However, KLF6 expression was down-regulated by overexpression of circ-ABCB10.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCirc-ABCB10 was first identified as a novel oncogene in thyroid cancer. Furthermore, it significantly enhanced the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer by targeting KLF6. Our findings suggested that circ-ABCB10 could be used as a potential therapeutic target in thyroid cancer.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20182", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202002_20182/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-02-26", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recent researches have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in many diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the exact function of lncRNA DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 5 (DGCR5) in the development of NSCLC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect DGCR5 expression in paired NSCLC patients' tissue samples and cell lines. The function of DGCR5 in NSCLC was detected through wound healing assay and transwell assay in vitro. Besides, mechanism assays were conducted to observe the interaction between DGCR5 and microRNA-218-5p (miR-218-5p).\n\n\nRESULTS\nDGCR5 was remarkably highly expressed in NSCLC tissues compared to that of adjacent normal tissues. The migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were significantly promoted via overexpression of DGCR5. However, the silence of DGCR5 significantly inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion. Moreover, RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-218-5p was down-regulated via overexpression of DGCR5, while miR-218-5p was up-regulated after the knockdown of DGCR5. Further experiments showed that miR-218-5p was a direct target of DGCR5 in NSCLC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDGCR5 enhances NSCLC cell migration and invasion via targeting miR-218-5p, indicating that DGCR5 may be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19561", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201911_19561/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-12-05", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignant tumor with a high mortality rate and poor prognosis. In this research, we investigated the exact role of long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNA) MNX1-AS1 in the metastasis of ESCC and its possible mechanism.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nTo investigate the functions of MNX1-AS1 in ESCC, quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect MNX1-AS1 expression of ESCC tissues and cells. Besides, functional assays, including transwell assay and wound healing assay, were performed. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and Western blot assay were used to explore the possible underlying regulatory mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of MNX1-AS1 was significantly increased in both ESCC tissues sample and cells. Moreover, knockdown of MNX1-AS1 markedly inhibited the migration and invasion of ESCC cells.

Besides, proliferation assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry assay were performed in BLCA cells after hsa_circ_0017247 was knocked down. Meanwhile, the Western blot assay was conducted to explore the target signaling pathway of hsa_circ_0017247. Furthermore, tumor formation and metastasis assays were also conducted in vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with the adjacent tissues, a significant upregulation in hsa_circ_0017247 expression was observed in BLCA samples. Functional assays showed that the inhibition of cell proliferation was induced via downregulating hsa_circ_0017247 in BLCA in vitro, while the promotion of cell proliferation was induced via downregulating hsa_circ_0017247 in BLCA in vitro.

The Wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted to explore the function of HOXA-AS2 on NSCLC metastasis. Furthermore, the mechanism assays were used to explore the interaction between HOXA-AS2 and microRNA-145-3p (miR-145-3p).\n\n\nRESULTS\nHOXA-AS2 expression level in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher than adjacent tissues. HOXA-AS2 expression was negatively correlated with disease-free survival of NSCLC patients. Moreover, the functional assays showed that the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were significantly inhibited after HOXA-AS2 in vitro silence.

Recent studies have revealed that circular RNAs play an important role in the progression of tumorigenesis. This study aims to identify how circular RNA_LARP4 functions in the progression of NPC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe performed Real Time quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) in 58 paired NPC patients' tissue samples and cell lines to detect circular RNA_LARP4 expression. The function of circular RNA_LARP4 in the NPC proliferation was identified by performing proliferation assay and colony formation assay. Moreover, the function of circular RNA_LARP4 in NPC metastasis was measured by performing scratch wound assay and transwell assay in vitro. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored through Western blot assay and RT-qPCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCircular RNA_LARP4 expression was significantly lower in NPC tissues compared to that in adjacent samples. Cell proliferation of NPC was inhibited after overexpression of circular RNA_LARP4 in vitro. Cell migration and invasion of NPC was inhibited after overexpression of circular RNA_LARP4 in vitro. Furthermore, the results of further experiments revealed that Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1) was downregulated via overexpression of circular RNA_LARP4 and was also a direct target of circular RNA_LARP4 in NPC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study suggests that circular RNA_LARP4 inhibits NPC cell proliferation and metastasis via targeting ROCK1 in vitro.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19557", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201911_19557/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-12-05", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

LINC00261 was studied in this research to identify how it affects the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Firstly, the expression of LINC00261 in NSCLC cells and paired samples of NSCLC tissue was detected by RT-qPCR. Then, the associations between LINC00261 expression level and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated. Furthermore, functional assays of cell proliferation, colony formation and transwell, as well as western blot assay, luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were conducted. Afterwards, the effects of LINC00261 expression on NSCLC formation and growing were confirmed by in vivo models. Results: As results, expression of LINC00261 was significantly down-regulated in tumor samples than that in normal samples, which was correlated with the lymphatic metastasis, tumor size, tumor stage as well as patient survival time. Knockdown of LINC00261 inhibited tumor growth and invasion ability in vitro. In addition, miR-105 was identified as a direct target of LINC00261 via mechanism experiments and its expression in tumor tissues negatively correlated to LINC00261 expression. Further experiments found that Four and expression of Half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) was negatively correlated with miR-105 but positively with LINC00261. Moreover, in vivo assays verified the overexpression of LINC00261 could suppress formation of NSCLC and regulate the expression of miR-105/FHL1 axis. Conclusions: These results indicate that LINC00261 could suppress metastasis and proliferation of NSCLC via suppressing miR-105/FHL1 axis, which may offer a new vision for interpreting the mechanism of NSCLC development.", "url": "https://www.jcancer.org/v10p6414.htm", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.7150_jca.32251/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "Journal of Cancer", "publishedDate": "2019-11-28", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recent literatures have shown that microRNA is critical during tumorigenesis. This study focuses on the influence of miR-30c-5p on the metastasis of GC and further explores its underlying mechanism.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBefore the study, expression level of miR-30c-5p and targeted protein was detected in 40 GC tissue samples and 5 GC cells by RT-qPCR. Meanwhile, correlation analysis was conducted between miR-30c-5p expression level and clinicopathological features. In addition, wound healing assay and cell invasion assay were utilized to identify whether miR-30c-5p could affect the migrated and invaded ability of GC cells. Western blotting assay and luciferase assay were used to explore the potential mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn GC tissues, miR-30c-5p expression level was significantly lower and was remarkably related with clinical features such as tumor node metastasis(TNM) stage and lymphatic metastasis. Moreover, the migrated and invaded ability of GC cells was enhanced through knockdown of miR-30c-5p, while overexpression of miR-30c-5p presented with reversed effect. Further study showed that miR-30c-5p inhibited the expression of its target spot, metastasis-associated protein 1(MTA1), and then suppressed the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition(EMT) which was important in the metastasis of GC.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results indicate that miR-30c-5p, a novel suppressor in tumorigenesis, could inhibit the metastasis and EMT via MTA1, which may offer a possible therapeutic target in GC.", "url": "https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753332217324642", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.1016_j.biopha.2017.06.084/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "publishedDate": "2017-07-08", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Fig. 1.

"OBJECTIVE\nRecently, the vital role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human diseases have got much attention. In this research, lncRNA DLX6-AS1 is studied to verify how it affects the development of cervical cancer (CC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nDLX6-AS1 expression was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) in both CC cells and tissue samples. Besides, functional experiments including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were performed. Meanwhile, the underlying mechanism was explored through qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. The function of DLX6-AS1 was also identified in vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBy comparing with corresponding tissues, the DLX6-AS1 expression level was significantly higher in CC samples. Moreover, cell growth ability and invaded ability of CC cells were inhibited after DLX6-AS1 was knocked down. Furthermore, the expression of FUS was inhibited after knockdown of DLX6-AS1. It was found that the expression level of FUS positively correlated to the expression of DLX6-AS1 in CC tissues. In addition, knockdown of DLX6-AS1 inhibited tumor formation and metastasis of CC in nude mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results suggest that DLX6-AS1 could enhance cell proliferation and metastasis of CC by upregulating FUS, which might be a potential therapeutic target in CC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18836", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201909_18836/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-09-21", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Recent studies have revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the progression of tumorigenesis. This work aims to identify how circ_0067934 functions in the progression of BC.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nCirc_0067934 expression of both 57 paired BC patients' tissue samples and cells was detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the function of circ_0067934 was identified by performing proliferation assay, colony formation assay, cell cycle assay, and Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay in vitro. Besides, the underlying mechanism was explored through Western blot assay and RT-qPCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, circ_0067934 expression was significantly higher in BC tissues when compared with that in adjacent non-tumor samples. Cell proliferation in BC was inhibited after knockdown of circ_0067934 in vitro. Moreover, cell cycle in BC was regulated after knockdown of circ_0067934 in vitro. Results of further experiments revealed that Mcl-1 was downregulated via the knockdown of circ_0067934 in BC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur work suggests that circ_0067934 enhances BC cell proliferation and regulates BC cell cycle via upregulating Mcl-1.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19444", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201911_19444/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-11-28", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. Recently, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumor progression has been well concerned by numerous researchers. In this research, lncRNA TTN-AS1 was studied to identify its biological function in the progression of prostate cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFirstly, Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to measure TTN-AS1 expression in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, in vitro role of TTN-AS1 in regulating prostate cancer cells was assessed. Tumor formation assay was conducted in NOD/SCID mice to explore the in vitro function of TTN-AS1. In addition, the luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to analyze the relationship between TTN-AS1 and miR-1271.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTTN-AS1 expression was remarkably higher in prostate cancer samples compared with that of corresponding ones. Moreover, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells were inhibited after TTN-AS1 was silenced. MiR-1271 was upregulated after the silence of TTN-AS1. Further mechanism assays showed that miR-1271 was a direct target of TTN-AS1 in prostate cancer. In addition, tumor formation and metastasis abilities were inhibited after in vivo knockdown of TTN-AS1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study discovers a potential oncogene in prostate cancer and demonstrates that TTN-AS1 enhances cell proliferation and migration via sponging miR-1271.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/19766", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201912_19766/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-12-21", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay and ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay were conducted to evaluate the regulatory effects of ZFAS1 on cellular behaviors of the NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the interaction between ZFAS1 and miR-193a-3p in mediating the progression of NSCLC was elucidated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nZFAS1 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC samples relative to adjacent tissues. The proliferation of NSCLC cells was inhibited by silence of ZFAS1, and conversely, ZFAS2 overexpression promoted the proliferative ability. Further experiments showed that miR-193a-3p was directly targeted by ZFAS1.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nZFAS1 could enhance cell growth ability of NSCLC by targeting miR-193a-3p, suggesting that ZFAS1 may be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/18535", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201908_18535/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": null, "publishedDate": "2019-08-06", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Melanoma is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. This study aims to identify how circ_0017247 functions in the progression of melanoma.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nCirc_0017247 expression of both melanoma patients' tissue samples and cell lines were detected by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, the function of circ_0017247 was identified by performing the Wound healing assay, the transwell assay, and the Matrigel assay in vitro. Besides, the mechanism assays were performed to uncover the interaction between circ_0017247 and miR-145. In addition, the tumor metastasis assays were also conducted in vivo.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, circ_0017247 expression was significantly higher in melanoma tissues compared with that in the skin tissues with a melanocytic nevus. The migrated length of the melanoma cells was reduced after circ_0017247 was silenced. Moreover, the number of migrated and invaded melanoma cells was reduced after circ_0017247 was silenced. Further experiments revealed that miR-145 was upregulated via knockdown of circ_0017247 and was also a direct target of circ_0017247 in melanoma. Furthermore, the tumor metastasis of melanoma was inhibited via knockdown of circ_0017247 in nude mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that circ_0017247 enhances melanoma cell migration and invasion via targeting miR-145 in vitro and in vivo.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20371", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202002_20371/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-03-07", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Our study aims to identify the role of SNHG16 in the metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure SNHG16 expression in 56 pancreatic carcinoma patients' tissues. Function assays, including wound healing assay, and transwell assay, were conducted to detect the effect of SNHG16 on the metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma. Besides, the luciferase assay was performed to explore the underlying mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe expression level of SNHG16 was upregulated in pancreatic carcinoma samples compared with adjacent tissues. Moreover, cell migration and cell invasion were repressed via the knockdown of SNHG16, while cell migration and cell invasion were promoted via the overexpression of SNHG16. Moreover, the expression of miR-200a-3p was upregulated via knockdown of SNHG16 while the expression of miR-200a-3p was downregulated via the upregulation of SNHG16 in vitro. Furthermore, it was discovered that SNHG16 acted as a competing endogenous RNA via sponging miR-200a-3p in pancreatic carcinoma.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that SNHG16 acts as an oncogene in pancreatic carcinoma and promotes cell metastasis via sponging miR-200a-3p, which might be a novel therapeutic strategy in pancreatic carcinoma.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20347", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_202002_20347/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2020-03-07", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

Moreover, the relationship between MNX1-AS1 expression and the overall survival rate of GC patients was explored. Furthermore, wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted. In addition, the underlying mechanism of MNX1-AS1 in GC was explored by performing RT-qPCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMNX1-AS1 expression in GC samples was significantly higher than that of the corresponding normal tissues. Meanwhile, MNX1-AS1 expression was associated with the overall survival time of GC patient. Moreover, the migration and invasion of GC cells were markedly promoted after MNX1-AS1 overexpression in vitro. The mRNA and protein expressions of CDKN1A were remarkably down-regulated after MNX1-AS1 overexpression. Furthermore, the expression level of CDKN1A was negatively correlated with the expression of MNX1-AS1 in GC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results suggested that MNX1-AS1 could enhance the metastasis and invasion of GC cells via suppressing CDKN1A.

In this research, lncRNA MIAT was explored to identify how it functions in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nReal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect MIAT expression in NSCLC patients. Next, we conducted cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay to identify its biological function. Further experiments were performed to explore the potential mechanism.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBy comparing with MIAT expression in adjacent tissues, MIAT expression level was significantly higher in NSCLC samples. Moreover, functional assays showed that cell growth ability of NSCLC cells was inhibited after MIAT was knocked down. In addition, the migrated and invaded ability of NSCLC cells was inhibited after MIAT was knocked down. Furthermore, the expression of TDP43 was downregulated by knockdown of MIAT. Meanwhile, it was found that TDP43 expression positively correlated to MIAT expression in NSCLC tissues.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults above suggest that MIAT could enhance cell proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC by upregulating TDP43, which suggests that MIAT may be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.", "url": "https://www.europeanreview.org/article/17702", "docPath": "dataset/stock-photo-papermill/10.26355_eurrev_201904_17702/article/paper.pdf", "publisher": "European review for medical and pharmacological sciences", "publishedDate": "2019-05-14", "figures": {"fig1": {"caption": "Figure 1.

In our research, we aim to research the function of circ-SMAD7 in the progression of glioma.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nCirc-SMAD7 expression was detected by quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) in glioma tissue patients. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine the association of circ-SMAD7 expression with several clinicopathological factors. Besides, cell proliferation assay, cell cycle assay, transwell assay, and Matrigel assay were conducted to detect the function of circ-SMAD7 in glioma. In addition, the interaction between circ-SMAD7 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in glioma was studied by performing qRT-PCR and Western blot assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCirc-SMAD7 expression was observed in glioma tissues when compared with adjacent samples. The expression of circ-SMAD7 was associated with patients' WHO stage and KPS score. Cell proliferation was inhibited and cell cycle was regulated after circ-SMAD7 was downregulated in glioma cells. Besides, cell migration and invasion were inhibited after circ-SMAD7 was downregulated in glioma cells. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of PCNA was repressed after circ-SMAD7 was knocked down in glioma cells. Furthermore, PCNA expression level positively correlated to circ-SMAD7 expression level in glioma samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study suggests that circ-SMAD7 promotes proliferation and metastasis of glioma via upregulating PCNA.
