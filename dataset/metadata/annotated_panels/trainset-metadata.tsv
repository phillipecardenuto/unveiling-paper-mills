(A) Phase-contrast microscopy (upper panel) and hrGFP direct fluorescence microscopy (lower panel) of HeLa cells that were mock-transfected (mock) and of HeLa cells that were transfected with targeting vector pA1.GFP.A2 mixed with ‘empty plasmid’ (−Rep) or mixed with plasmid pGAPDH.Rep68(Y156F) encoding the endonuclease-deficient version of Rep68 Y156F. In parallel, phase-contrast microscopy (upper panel) and hrGFP direct fluorescence microscopy (lower panel) was carried out on HeLa cells transfected with pA1.GFP.A2 together with increasing amounts of rep68 expression construct pGAPDH.Rep68 (i.e. 1, 3.3, 10, 33.3 and 100 ng). The total amount of transfected recombinant DNA was kept constant by adding, whenever required, extra ‘empty plasmid’. Micrographs were acquired at 72-h post-transfection. Numerals below the various columns correspond to the deployed amounts (in nanograms) of the rep68 expression plasmids and of the pA1.GFP.A2 targeting DNA. Original magnification: 100×.

Immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence.  (C) Tim54p is an integral membrane protein. 150-μg mitochondria isolated from strain 494 were sonicated, treated with either  0.1 M sodium carbonate, 1.5 M sodium chloride, or no additions  (buffer), and centrifuged. Pellets (p) and supernatants (s) were  analyzed by immune blotting with antibodies to the HA epitope  (Tim54–HA), F1β, a peripheral membrane protein, and Tim23p,  an integral membrane protein. (D) Tim54p is located in the inner  membrane. Mitochondria from strain 494 were sonicated and the  resulting vesicles were loaded onto sucrose step-gradients. After  centrifugation, fractions were collected and analyzed by immune  blotting with antibodies to the HA epitope (Tim54–HA), the inner membrane protein, F1β, or the outer membrane protein,  OM45. Fraction 1 represents the top of the gradient. (E) The carboxyl terminus of Tim54 faces the intermembrane space. Mitochondria isolated from strain 494 were digested with 150 μg/ml  trypsin for 20 min on ice, followed by the addition of 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and analyzed by immune blotting with antiserum to  Tom70p, F1β, Tim23p, and Tim54p. To expose proteins located  in the intermembrane space, the mitochondrial outer membrane  was ruptured by osmotic shock (OS), and proteins were digested  with 150 μg/ml trypsin as above. (F) Import of Tim54p into mitochondria requires an inner membrane potential. Mitochondria  were isolated from wild-type strain D273-10B and incubated with  the 35S-labeled Tim54 protein. In one sample, the inner membrane potential was dissipated (− Δψ) by the addition of 50 μM  carbonyl cyanide m-chlorphenylhydrazone and 1 μM valinomycin prior to the import reaction. After 15 min at 30°C, imports  were stopped by incubation at 0°C. Mitochondria were treated  with 50-μg/ml proteinase K for 20 min at 0°C, isolated by centrifugation, and solubilized in SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the radiolabeled Tim54p  was identified by fluorography. (G) The bulk of the Tim54 protein faces the intermembrane space. Tim54p was imported into  wild-type mitochondria in the presence (+ Δψ) or absence (− Δψ)  of inner membrane potential as described above. After import,  the mitochondrial outer membrane was disrupted by osmotic  shock, and the resulting mitoplasts were digested with 50 μg/ml  proteinase K for 20 min. Mitoplasts were recovered by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The full-length Tim54 protein (Tim54p) and a fragment of Tim54p  (Tim54p*) protected from protease digestion are indicated.		PMC2132641_JCB.14649f2a.jpg

The cell viability rates were examined using an MTT assay, as shown in the <b>bar</b> <b>graph</b>. Compared with 0 ng/mL TNF-α (vehicle control), the stimulation with 0.1–8 ng/mL TNF-α did not affect cell viability (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, 10 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL TNF-α significantly inhibited the viability of A549 cells (*p&lt;0.05) in a dose-dependent manner with reduction rates of 14.3% and 20.7%, respectively. (B) 200 µL of 1×105/mL A549 cell suspension was seeded in the upper chamber of a Transwell that was previously covered with 1% gelatin until 80% confluence. After the well was pre-incubated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α for 24 hours, the Pa was determined according to the rate of fluorescence intensity of FITC-Dextran in the upper and lower chambers by a multifunctional microplate reader, as shown in the <b>bar</b> <b>graph</b>, TNF-α treatment increased Pa by 23.4% compared with the control group. (C) A549 cells were exposed to 10 ng/mL TNF-α for 24 hours, and the total protein of HIF-1α was then extracted.

The three modular components of the streptavidin sensor are depicted. The recognition module (green) constitutes an aptamer that binds to streptavidin. The transducer module (red) comprises two strands which form a weakly base paired stem. Folding of the recognition domain provides additional stability that facilitates the hybridization of the stem region in the recognition module. The Spinach module (black) binds to and activates the fluorescence of DFHBI, but only when the transducer module forms a stem.(b) Optimization of stem transducer modules for streptavidin sensors. The streptavidin aptamer was fused to Spinach by one of five different transducer modules. These transducer modules contained different lengths and combination of G-C, A-U and mismatched base pairs, and were chosen because they were predicted to have a very low probability of duplex formation using the prediction software Mfold. Streptavidin sensors containing different stems (stem 1-5) were incubated with 10 μM DFHBI, 0.2 μM RNA in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml (1.7 μM) streptavidin, and fluorescence emission was measured. The optimal transducer module (stem 3) was chosen because in the context of the sensor it displayed low background fluorescence, with a 10.3-fold increase in fluorescence signal upon incubation with streptavidin. The experiment was replicated three times, an average fluorescence signal and SEM were calculated and show in <b>bar</b> <b>graph</b>.(c) Emission spectra of the RNA sensor for streptavidin in the presence or absence of streptavidin. Spectra were collected using 0.2 μM RNA, 10 μM DFHBI and 100 μg/ml (1.7 μM) streptavidin. Fluorescence signal is negligible in the absence of streptavidin and increases 10.3-fold in the presence of streptavidin.(d) Emission spectra of the RNA sensor for human thrombin in the presence or absence of thrombin. Spectra were collected using 0.2 μM RNA, 10 μM DFHBI and 40 μg/mL (1.0 μM) thrombin.

Olfactory Sensory Neurons (OSN) connect to one specific glomerulus where they connect with Mitral (Mi) and Periglomerular (PG) cells. Mitral cells are the principal cells within the OB and project their axons to the PC. These neurons are modulated by PG and Granule (Gr) cells (see main text for details). In the piriform cortex, Mi cell axons connect to pyramidal (Pyr) cells and inhibitory interneurons called feed forward (Ff) cells that project their axons to the apical dendrites of Pyr cells, modulating the excitatory input coming from the OB. Pyramidal cells implement an autoassociative network, projecting their axons to other Pyr neurons and to a second group of inhibitory interneurons called Feedback (Fb) cells. In our model, Pyr cells also connect to inhibitory interneurons in the HDB (Gb). These neurons inhibit cholinergic cells (Ac) that project their axons back to the PC and OB, modulating the activity of PG, Mi, Gr, Pyr, and Fb cells. (B) Pyramidal cells are randomly connected to Mi cells. The <b>graphs</b> show Mi (Bi) and Pyr (Bii) activation over a 1 s simulation for a single odorant. Each Pyr cells is connected to 20% of the Mi cells in the OB. Note that mitral cell activities are arranged in neighborhoods for the sake of ease of presentation only. (C) Cholinergic modulation in the model depends on Ac cell activation. The <b>graph</b> shows the changes in ACh modulation (M) for different levels of Ac cell activation (A). In our model, average Ac cell activation (A) varies between 0 and 0.6 and is described in Equation (2). This activation sets the level of cholinergic modulation in the different neuronal groups and defines how cellular effects in these groups, such as firing threshold, spontaneous activity, suppression of synaptic transmission, etc. are modulated. The relationship between Ac activation and ACh modulation in our model is described in Equation (9). (D) Normalized synaptic weights in Pyr autoassociative connections before and after learning. The <b>graphs</b> show the normalized weight matrix  for the Pyr-Pyr connections before (Di) and after (Dii) a set of 9 training sessions. In order to help visualization, only the active synapses are shown. The sum of  in both (Di) and (Dii) is equal to 1, the difference here is that in (Di) the weights are spread over most of the active synapses in the network. Over the course of 9 training session (Dii), these weights gradually concentrate in the connections between neurons that are part of the learned odor pattern.		PMC5099168_fncel-10-00256-g0001.jpg

When healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in the presence of supernatant medium from cultures of each of the gCSCs, T cell proliferation was inhibited, as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of CD3+ T cell carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling that measures T cell proliferation. For each of the matched gCSCs under hypoxic conditions, T cell proliferation was further inhibited compared to normoxia. Representative FACS <b>histograms</b> or dot plots are shown on the left, and the summary bar <b>graphs</b> of percentage changes are shown on the right. T cells cultured with neurosphere cell medium served as a control. B. The supernatants from the gCSCs induced an increase in the number of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in the gated CD4+ T cells, which is further enhanced under conditions of hypoxia. C.

The nucleolar structure (fluorescence microscopy), the accumulation of mature 18S and 28S rRNAs (electropherograms), pre-rRNA processing (high-resolution northern blotting), and steady-state accumulation of p53 (fluorescent western blotting) were monitored. (b) PCA showing a classification of r-proteins according to their requirement for nucleolar structure maintenance. Each r-protein was depleted in three knockdown experiments, each performed with a different siRNA. The image-processing algorithm that we designed for this analysis involves selecting five discriminant shape and textural features, computing five dk values, and reducing the five dimensions to two by PCA. In the resulting plot, each coloured dot represents one population of cells treated with one siRNA. Dot colour is indicative of the targeted protein: green for SSU r-proteins and magenta for LSU r-proteins. The mean of three populations of cells treated with a non-targeting control siRNA (SCR) is shown in red. Blue symbols represent the six calibration controls (FBL, GFP, nucleolin, nucleophosmin, MOCK and TIF1A, see Supplementary Fig. 1). Insets show images of the nuclei of cells depleted of representative proteins with the DNA stained in blue and the nucleoli appearing in green (FBL). For a few representative examples, a specific symbol is used (for example, a diamond for uL5). RPL, r-proteins of the LSU; RPS, r-proteins of the SSU. (c) r-proteins and calibration controls classified according to the severity of nucleolar disruption caused by their absence. The iNo was defined as the sum of the dk values of the five most discriminant shape and textural features identified in this work (Methods section). Higher iNo correspond to more severe disruption. Colour-coding as in b. The coloured dots are the means of three individual experiments (shown in grey). Note: the r-proteins are named according to a recently revised nomenclature24 where the ‘e' prefix stands for eukaryote-specific and ‘u' for universal (present in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes).

Either way, tracking will be terminated after λ3 changes its sign twice and becomes a positive value. The sign of λ3 becomes negative before the front reaches a junction center. To ensure that the branch is reconnected by tracking, the process needs to wait until the sign changes twice—which indicates that the front truly passed through the junction area. Then the intensity value at the termination points is examined and either trajectory whose intensity value at the termination point is less than the other will be discarded.

(A–S) The effect of the specific MMP-9 inhibitor S24994 on mossy fiber sprouting and aberrant synaptogenesis in the DG dendritic layer of the rat organotypic hippocampal cultures treated with either kainate (B, C, E, F, H, and I) or picrotoxin (K, L, N, O, R, and S) or untreated (A, D, G, J, M, and P). High-power confocal micrographs (A–F and J–O, single channel; G–I and P–S, respective overlays) are taken from cultures immunolabeled for synaptoporin, a mossy fibers boutons marker (A–C and J–L; and G–I and P–S, red), and MAP-2 (D–F and M–O; and G–I and P–S, green). Pharmacologic MMP-9 inhibition results in a dramatic decrease in the density of ectopic mossy fibers boutons upon both kainate (compare B and C) and picrotoxin (compare K and L) treatment. (T) Quantitative evaluation of the effect of S24994 on either kainate- (left) or picrotoxin (right)-mediated sprouting, measured as the mean number of synaptoporin-positive boutons per unit volume (30,000 μm3) of the DG.

(a) Cells (2 × 104) were seeded in 24-well culture plates, and incubated for the indicated number of days with 10-8 M of different phenolic acids. In another series of experiments, cells were cultured in the absence of phenolic acids. The figure presents the ratio of the cell number in the presence/absence of the different phenolic acids. A typical experiment is presented, which was performed three more times with similar results. Inset: Data presented in the figure were analyzed by the application of the exponential decay <b>equation</b> , in which y is the observed ratio of the cell number in the presence/absence of the phenolic acid, y0 is the maximal observed decrease of cell proliferation (plateau), A1 is 1 - y0, x0 is the initial time of observation (= 0), and x is the time (in days) of the y observation (abscissa of the y observation). The <b>equation</b> after transformation is rearranged as ln [(y - y0) / (1 - y0)] = -xt, the left side of which is the logit of the earlier quantity. From this <b>equation</b> one can obtain the calculation of t, which is an estimate of the half-life (t1/2) of the effect of the applied agent. In the case of the monotonous curves (sinapic acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid), this t1/2 was varying between 0.9 and 1.3 days. In the case of ferulic acid, in which the observed curve follows that of sinapic acid and ferulic acid for short incubation times and jumps to that of protocatechuic acid and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid for longer incubation times, the calculated t1/2 was 5.7 days. Finally, for caffeic acid, in which a sigmoidal curve was observed, data were not well fitted to the curve and the calculated t1/2 was 4.1 days. (b) Dose effect of phenolic acids on T47D cell proliferation. Cells (2 × 104) were incubated for 5 days in the absence or the presence of the indicated concentrations of phenolic acids, ranging from 10-12 to 10-6 M.

Patient is a 21 y/o male who presents after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was neurologically intact. Representative sagittal (A) and axial (B) computed tomography and sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (C) were obtained. A compression fracture with compromise of the superior endplate of L1 is found. Nondisplaced laminar fractures were present in the posterior elements bilaterally (Figure 2 A, white arrow). MRI imaging showed increased signal in the interspinous space, possibly indicating ligamentous injury and confirming involvement of posterior spinal elements. The patient receives one point for the compression fracture and an additional point for burst characteristics (posterior bony fractures). MRI suggests posterior ligamentous disruption (2 points). The patient was neurologically intact (0 points). The comprehensive score of 4 suggests either operative therapy or external orthosis may be used. We chose conservative treatment in this case.

All panels are dorsal views, anterior top, except (f'), which is a lateral view, anterior right. (a'-e') Maximum intensity projections of deconvolved confocal z-stacks reveal the detailed morphology of IPN neurons. (a, a') An interneuron in the vIPN that extends neurites exclusively within the vIPN neuropil. The soma (arrow) is located on the R of the midline but the neurites enter the neuropil on both L and R sides. A second, more weakly labeled neuron is also visible. (b, b') The soma of this neuron, as with most IPN neurons, occupies the central cellular 'core' of the nucleus whilst its arbor extends radially to synapse with afferent habenular axons that encircle the core. (c, c') A vIPN neuron with a flattened dendritic arbor. In this specimen two neurons were labeled. One of these (soma marked by arrow in (c')) radiates an extensive dendritic arbor exclusively on the R of the midline within the vIPN neuropil. The lateral projection (inset in (c')) reveals the arbor is extremely flattened along the DV axis (arrowheads in (c')). (d, d') Neuron with a dorsally located soma (just outside the dIPN neuropil), which elaborates two arbors in spatially distinct regions of the IPN. The larger of these arbors (arrowhead in (d')) is connected to the cell body (arrow in (d')) by a long, unbranched process. As is also the case for some of the other interneurons, it is unclear whether these arbors are axonal, dendritic or both in nature. (e, e') A dIPN projection neuron that extends an axon just caudal to the IPN, most probably synapsing with neurons of the serotonergic raphé nucleus. This neuron has dendritic processes located both in the dorsal (D) and ventral (V) neuropils. (f, f') In this specimen, three projection neurons are labeled. Axons extend around the IPN (arrowhead in (f)) as well as caudally and dorsally (arrows in (f, f')).

The upper (phosphorylated) form of Cnn, however, was undetectable on much longer exposures of this <b>blot</b>, and we consistently failed to detect this upper band in several independent Polo-depletion experiments (unpublished data). Thus, we are very confident that the absence of this band from the Polo-depleted cells is not simply due to the lower amount of protein loaded in this lane.(D) <b>Western blot</b> analysis of a 2-D gel of nontreated cycling S2R+ cell extracts (N) or extracts enriched for mitotic cells by colchicine treatment (M) treated with a control dsRNA (GFP) or a dsRNA against Polo.

X. helleri fgfr1 is up-regulated during sword development. When maturation is induced by exogenous testosterone, fgfr1 is up-regulated in the ventral-most caudal fin rays in developing swords at 5 and 10 days of treatment (dt)(A, F). Weaker expression of fgfr1 can also be detected in non-sword rays (A, D, E). fgfr1 is not up-regulated in untreated control fins (C). fgfr1 expression overlaps with msxC, which is also up-regulated in developing sword rays ([23], B and I). In later stages of treatment, up-regulation of both genes in the distal part of the dorsal-most rays is observed in some individuals (G), which may develop a small &quot;upper sword&quot; ([20]). Like fgfr1, msxC expression is also detected in non-sword rays (G, H). When maturation is induced by exogenous testosterone in the platyfish, X. maculatus fgfr1 and msxC are similarly expressed in all caudal fin rays after 5 dt (J and K). The expression levels are comparable to untreated fish (L). After 10 dt fgfr1 is more strongly expressed in the ventral-most fin-rays (O) compared to other rays (M, N), which may correspond to the formation of a small ventral swordlet [20,22].

Following exposure to 30 mmHg for 2 and 3 days, the level of OPA1 mRNA was measured with specific primers and probes for rat OPA1 and GAPDH using Taqman qPCR and the level of total OPA1 protein was also measured using <b>western blot</b>. OPA1 expression was significantly decreased in pressurized cells (A), compared control cells. However, OPA1 protein expression did not show a difference between control and pressure treated cells (B). Three protein samples from three independent experiments were loaded for each group. The OPA1 protein bands show the positions, based on comparison with size standards, of approximately the 80 (S) to 90 kDa (L) forms of OPA1. The <b>blot</b> was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody (~42 kDa) to confirm similar protein loading in each lane (B). Mitochondria were separated from cytosol by differential centrifugation and OPA1 content was analyzed by <b>western blotting</b>. An 80 kDa isoform of OPA1 was observed in the cytosolic fraction whereas 80 and 90 kDa isoforms of OPA1 were observed in the mitochondrial fraction (C).

It did not crossreact with other bestrophins. B: A commercially available anti-Best2 antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals (NOVUS) was also specific to hbest2 and mBest2.

The parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) was detected by staining with α-pyUIS4. Parasites (both extracellular and intracellular) were stained with pyCSP. The percent UIS4-CSP double stained parasites was determined by counting parasites staining with both UIS4 (PVM staining; see B) and CSP and dividing this number by the number of parasites staining with CSP (total parasites including extracellular parasites). Numbers are the average of triplicates ± SEM (at least 300 parasites counted) and were statistically significant using the unpaired t test analysis.

The newborns in Lanes 1-3 were categorized as having early-onset sepsis (EONS) based on clinical manifestations and hematological indices and all received i.v. antibiotics. The newborn in Lane 4 had a negative sepsis work-up. Blood cultures remained negative for all 4 newborns. The presence of a conspicuous immunoreactive band corresponding to the β-chain (∼42 kDa) in Lanes 1-3 is consistent with our defined switched-on Hp pattern. The absence of this band indicates for a switched-off pattern in Lane 4. The band ∼9 kDa (Lanes 1&amp;2) corresponds to the α1-chain whereas the band at ∼20 kDa (Lanes 2-3) corresponds to the α2-chain. Thus, the cord blood Hp patterns and phenotypes depicted in this gel are: switched-on pattern and Hp1-1 (Lane 1), switched-on pattern and Hp1-2 (Lane 2), switched-on pattern and Hp2-2 (Lane 3) and switched-off pattern and Hp0-0 (Lane 4). In our cohort, among preterm newborns with switched-on Hp pattern (present β-chain, n = 81), the distribution of Hp phenotypes was as follows: 6.0% Hp0-0 (5/81, no α-chain detected), 19.3% (16/81) Hp1-1, 32.5% (26/81) Hp1-2, and 42.1% (34/81) Hp2-2. The higher band intensity of the α2-chain compared to that of the α1-chain suggest that phenotype impacts on total Hp immunoreactivity.

Nucleotide numbers refer to the positions in the MNV-1 genome. The effect of the introduced nucleotide changes on the VF1 and VP1 protein sequences are also illustrated. Note that the mutations introduced in M1, M10 and M20 do not affect the coding sequence of the capsid protein VP1 but introduce a stop codon into VF1 at various positions. (B) Coupled in vitro transcription and translation reactions confirming the lack of VF1 expression in M1 and M10 viruses, with M20 producing a marginally shorter VF1 product. PCR products containing the subgenomic RNA region under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were generated from cDNA constructs of either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutants and subsequently used for transcription and translation (TNT) in vitro in the presence of S35 methionine. Radioactively labeled proteins were subsequent resolved by SDS-PAGE, prior to exposure to film. VP1* represents a potential shorter VP1 product generated by translation initiation from an AUG initiation codon in-frame yet downstream from the authentic VP1 AUG. (C) <b>Western blot</b> analysis of RAW264.7 cells infected with low passage, sequence verified stocks of either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutant viruses.

To breed mice with low dystrophin levels, female XistΔhs mice, carrying a mutation in the Xist promoter which coordinates X-inactivation, were crossed with dystrophin negative mdx males. During embryogenesis, the maternal X-chromosome encoding a functional dystrophin gene will be preferentially (60–90%) inactivated as a result of the mutated Xist promoter. The XistΔhs mice were a kind gift from N. Brockdorff (MRC Clinical Sciences Center, London, UK, current affiliation Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, UK). B. Picture of a representative <b>Western blot</b>. The percentage of dystrophin was determined for the quadriceps of all mdx-XistΔhs mice by <b>Western blot</b> (2–9 technical replicates per mouse). The percentage of individual mice was determined using a concentration curve made from wild type samples. Myosin was used as a loading control. C. Skewed X-inactivation resulted in dystrophin levels of 3–47% (mean 22.7, stdev 12.1, n = 24) (as determined by <b>Western blot</b>) in the female mdx-XistΔhs offspring. Each bar represents the dystrophin level of an individual mouse. The dystrophin levels of the individual mice belonging to the three dystrophin groups can be appreciated from this graph. D.

GPI−[RML] (lanes 5, 7) and GPI−/GPI−[ME7] (lane 17) brain homogenates gave rise to ladders reflecting multimers with molecular weights extending to &gt;250 kDa, which were reduced to monomers by PK digestion, while GPI−[ME7] homogenate gave no detectable signals. (B) <b>Western blot</b> of PK-digested brain homogenates treated or not with PNGase. Lanes 3, 5, 7, 9 show, from top to bottom, diglycosylated, monoglycosylated and unglycosylated, truncated PrP; PNGase-treated samples (lanes 4, 6, 8, 10) show a single band corresponding to unglycosylated, truncated PrP. Samples from tgGPI− mice (lanes 1, 11) show two bands, corresponding to truncated, monoglycosylated (top) and unglycosylated PrP, and, after PNGase treatment, a single band corresponding to truncated, deglycosylated PrP (lanes 2, 12). Because anchorless PrP is retained inefficiently by PVDF membranes [69], 24 times more total protein was loaded for GPI− than for C57 samples, to give about the same signal strength. (C) Sandwich ELISA of PK-treated samples. Absorbance of quadruplicate samples is plotted against log[input protein]. Samples a to g are identified in panel D; h, uninfected C57 brain homogenate. The abundance of a sample relative to that of RML can be read off by comparing the amounts of protein required to give the same absorbance. For example, an absorbance of 0.1 is given by 0.01 µg GPI−[RML] and 0.5 µg C57[RML] brain homogenate (total protein prior to PK treatment), therefore the abundance of GPI−[RML] is about 50 times higher than that of C57[RML] PrPres. In Figure S2 absorbance of the same samples is plotted against input protein on a linear scale, to show that the response is almost linear up to a protein input of 1.5 µg/well. (D) The PrPres signals (“pix”) from the <b>western blots</b> of Figure 1A were quantified relative to C57[RML] and the log of the ratio was plotted (red bars).

Correlation maps, presented in radiological view (axial, coronal and sagittal slices from left to right), show the correlation between each temporally independent component and the concatenated down-sampled envelopes of each voxel. Variable correlation thresholds were used to aid visualisation and are shown on each map's colour bar. Independent time courses were tested using a mixed-effects GLM, which identified components that showed strong changes between the task and rest blocks. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a multi-step-up test (Nichols and Hayasaka, 2003). In all GLMs, the average eye-blink time course was included as a nuisance regressor and hence all statistical inferences are orthogonal to eye-blink activity. For each frequency band, five correlation maps are presented for components whose corrected p-values were found to be significant (p &lt; 0.05).

Doxorubicin-treated LM7 cells show an increased expression level of p-JNK compared to untreated cells, whereas in U2OS there is a slight decrease in p-JNK after doxorubicin treatment. After concurrent treatment with BI-78D3, p-JNK expression levels are diminished, indicative of inhibition of JIP1 scaffold function.		PMC3717953_oncotarget-03-1169-g004.jpg

Recanalisation of the jejunal segment was observed without extravasation (c). Embolisation using 0.6 g IPM/CS was performed from the same site of the jejunal artery as the first TAE. Haemostasis was successfully obtained and no clinical or laboratory sign suggesting rebleeding was observed after the second TAE. The patient died at 163 days after TAE because of the progression of malignant lymphoma.		PMC3731674_40064_2013_408_Fig1_HTML.jpg

Dissociated hippocampal neurons at DIV3, DIV7, and DIV12 were immunostained with the anti-rEag1 (A, B) or the anti-rEag2 (C, D) antibodies (shown in green; left panels), followed by counterstaining with the antibody for the dendritic marker MAP2 or the axonal marker tau (shown in red; middle panels). Merged images are shown in the right panels. (A) rEag1 immunoreactivities were localized in cell bodies, as well as in MAP2-positive and MAP2-negative (arrows) processes. (B) rEag1 immunoreactivities were present in the axonal compartment that was clearly defined by the immunofluorescence signal of tau (arrows). For DIV12 neurons in both (A) and (B), note the presence of punctate rEag1 staining patterns throughout proximal and distal neurites. (C, D) rEag2 immunoreactivities were present in both MAP2-positive and tau-positive processes. No significant rEag2 puncta were observed. Scale bar, 25 μm.		PMC3926332_1471-2202-15-23-1.jpg

A 15 mm movement of the phantom along the long axis of the left ventricle model was used to mimic bulk cardiac motion. The mis-registration between the external reference scans and the accelerated data derived from coherent FSE induced severe artifacts in the SENSE reconstructed images for R = 2 (top). The artifacts were pronounced for R = 3. In comparison, SCSE-FSE was immune to bulk motion induced shifts in the phantom (middle) as was self-calibrated coherent FSE in conjunction with SENSE reconstruction (bottom). For the latter coil sensitivity maps were deduced from 32 central k-space lines while a decimation factor of R = 2 and R = 3 was employed to generate undersampled data. Imaging parameters were: in-plane spatial resolution  =  (1.3×1.3) mm2, slice thickness  = 8 mm, TEeff  = 77 ms, receiver bandwidth  = 454 Hz/pixel for all data sets.

Graphic representation of Tat-MYC and Tat-Bcl-2 fusion proteins. We cloned the cDNAs for either human MYC or human Bcl-2 in frame with the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 Tat as well as a V5 epitope tag and 6xHis tags. B. The fusion proteins localize to the appropriate intracellular compartment. A lawn of confluent 3T3 cells was exposed to either purified recombinant Tat-MYC or Tat-Bcl-2 or left untreated (NT). The cells were washed 2 hours later, fixed and stained with a monoclonal antibody to V5 (Green) and with a Hoechst 9934 nuclear stain (Blue). The Tat-MYC protein largely localized to the nuclear region in this timeframe, whereas the Tat-Bcl-2 remained in the cytoplasmic and perinuclear space. C. Tat-MYC rapidly localizes to the nucleus in primary human HSPCs. Human cord blood derived cells were pulsed with a single exposure of Tat-MYC. The cells were washed 1 hour later and the cells were collected at the indicated time points for analysis. The cells were lysed in a NP-40 buffer in order to separate the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic fraction from the nuclear fraction. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and <b>western blot</b> using monoclonal antibody to V5 and ß-actin. D. Tat-MYC was present in the nuclear fraction for a transient period of time. Human cord blood cells were treated as described for panel C. The nuclear fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and <b>western blotting</b> using a monoclonal antibody to the V5 tag. The bulk of the protein was lost between 24 and 48 hours. There was no detectable protein left at any point after 48 hours. E. and F. To test the function of Tat-Myc and Tat-Bcl-2, primary murine CD4+ T-cells were activated with monoclonal antibody to CD3 for 48 hours. The frequency of live cells was measured in the starting population of cells (black bars). The cells were then replated in media alone (NT), or media supplemented with Tat-Cre (TC) or increasing concentrations of either Tat-MYC (TM) (E), or Tat-Bcl-2 (TB) (F). Activated T-cells cultured with Tat-MYC, but not Tat-Cre, retain a blasting phenotype and continue to proliferate after the antigenic stimulation G. To further test the biological function of recombinant Tat-MYC, primary murine CD4+ T-cells were CFSE labeled and activated in vitro with monoclonal antibody to CD3 for 48 hours. After activation, the cells were washed and the live cells were isolated by ficoll-hypaque centrifugation. The cells were then replated in media supplemented with 5 µg/ml Tat-Cre (first panel) or 5 µg/ml Tat-MYC (second panel). The frequency of live cells was measured by flow cytometry. H. The activated T-cells were further assessed by CFSE signal in order to determine whether the addition of Tat-MYC can promote proliferation in addition to survival.		PMC4149411_pone.0105525.g001.jpg

However the scallops visualized depend on the level of depth. At 0 degrees midesophageal view, when the aortic valve is visualized, the A1/P1 scallops are noted at the leaflet tips. When the TEE probe is advanced further into the esophagus past the midesophageal level, the A3/P3 scallops are identified at the leaflet tips [16]. Of note, the A2 scallop of the mitral valve is flail with a posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation jet. Panel B demonstrates a commissural view at 60 degrees. In this view, the lateral most scallop (close to the appendage) is P1. One can also visualize the central, flail A2 scallop. The P3 scallop is also well visualized in this view.

In neuroblast clones of the LALv1 lineage-specific enhancer Gal4s label the wild-type LALv1 neurons because they are active in the lineage (for example, OK371 and Per). Inability to label the LALv1 neurons in otd−/− neuroblast clones of the LALv1 lineage (detectable by absence of Otd immunolabelling) will suggest that the enhancers become suppressed in the mutant neurons. The brains in B–E and J–M show wild-type MARCM clones of the LALv1 lineage labelled by OK371-Gal4 and Per-Gal4, respectively. The insets in B–E and J–M show that these cells express Otd. The brains in F–I and N–Q show otd−/− clones of the LALv1 lineage. Otd expression is lost in one hemisphere in these brains (white arrowhead in G and O; compare with the Otd expression within white dotted lines in the other brain hemisphere). Neither the OK371-Gal4 (F) nor the Per-Gal4 (N) enhancers drive the expression of UAS-mCD8::GFP in these cells and the transformed lineage is not labelled in these experiments.

The eGFP and mCherry open reading frames (ORF) are fused by a ribosome skipping sequence (T2A) where translating ribosomes skip from a Gly to a Pro codon without forming a peptide bond while maintaining the reading frame to produce two distinct polypeptides [39, 40]. In the TLR, the eGFP and mCherry ORFs are positioned in different frames and NHEJ repair of a DSB directed to the GFP ORF will, in one out of three events, place ΔeGFP in frame with mCherry - leading to mCherry production. Since the eGFP ORF contains an insertion harboring a premature termination codon (and lacks a start codon), its expression can only be recovered upon HDR-mediated repair following delivery of an appropriate homologous template. The reading frame for each fluorescent protein is indicated in parentheses. b Outline of siRNA and drug treatment protocol. In one set of experiments, the 293/TLR cell line was transfected with the indicated siRNAs (yellow box) and 24 h later expression constructs driving synthesis of Cas9 and sgRNAs and an eGFP donor template were introduced into the cells. In a second set of experiments, the 293/TLR cell line was first transfected with expression constructs driving synthesis of Cas9 and sgRNAs and an eGFP donor template. Compounds were added 16 h later (orange box). In both cases, cells were allowed to propagate for 5 days before FACS analysis. c Knockdown of DNA-PK, DNA Ligase IV, and PI3K-p110α in 293/TLR cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. <b>Western blots</b> were probed with antibodies to the indicated proteins.

Giemsa staining shows that treating T-LPN cells with GSI-I or BTZ alone induced mild increase in apoptotic cells. Combined treatment by GSI-I and BTZ was much more effective in inducing apoptosis in T-LPN cells. Jurkat and H9 cells were the least and most sensitive to the effects of the combined treatment. Morphological features consistent with apoptosis included cellular shrinkage, cytoplasm vacuolization, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation (original magnification: ×400). B. Examples of flow cytometry dot plots showing that, compared with control untreated T-LPN cells, the Annexin V-positive cells (right upper and lower quadrants) are remarkably increased after combined treatment with GSI-I and BTZ than after treatment with a single agent. C. Although GSI-I or BTZ caused cell apoptosis when used as single agents, the effects of combined treatment was more robust (*: P &lt; 0.0001 compared with control, GSI-I, and BTZ). D. GSI-I or BTZ as a single agent decreased the proliferation of T-LPN cells, with MOLT-4 and HuT 78 demonstrating more pronounced effects than Jurkat and H9 cells.

Three pairs of AstA-IR DLAa neurons co-express GFP and run through the median abdominal nerve to innervate the hindgut and posterior midgut (see F). The membrane-targeted GFP distinctly marks the projections of these neurons. Two single optical sections (insets in D''') reveal six co-labelled cell bodies. (E) AstA34-Gal4 expression in the TAG is absent with tsh-Gal80. (F) AstA and GFP labeling are present in neuronal processes at the hindgut, which extend onto the posterior midgut (Malpighian tubules have been removed during dissection). (G) The rectal part of the hindgut is likewise innervated by double-labelled neurons. (H) GFP is expressed in most of the AstA-producing EECs that are scattered within the epithelium of the posterior midgut. The maximum intensity projection of a single EEC in the inset of H''' illustrates that the main GFP signal is restricted to the narrow apical portion of the cells. (I) GFP expression is absent from gut neurons in individuals carrying tsh-Gal80, but remains in the AstA EECs. (Malpighian tubules have been removed during dissection.)

No evidence of haemorrhagic transformation of areas of parenchymal abnormality was seen. DWI-MRI showed patchy infarcts in left MCA territory. T2-FLAIR also confirmed the presence of patchy infarcts in the left hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows that the left MCA has reanalysed however, there remains some poor flow into the branches with the suggestion of some stenosis at the bifurcation. 24 hour CTA showed evidence of partial recanalization. Poor flow at the bifurcation possibly due to stenosis. Background: Despite thrombolysis, the patient showed only partial recanalization/reperfusion. On 24 hour CTA, poor flow into the branches was observed suggestive of stenosis at the bifurcation despite recanalization. There is evidence of infarction involving the basal ganglia and some patchy changes in the left MCA territory. Long-term prognosis of the patient was poor (mRS = 4 at 90 days).

(A) Sagittal CT sections show that wild-type incisor enamel becomes X-ray opaque due to increased mineral density (secondary mineralization) that occurs at the beginning of the maturation stage. Mineral density increases gradually throughout maturation and following eruption. Transverse CT sections, taken at points indicated by the dotted lines, show the enamel layer is complete across the width of the labial aspect of the incisor. (B) In contrast, onset of secondary mineralization is delayed in heterozygous EnamS55I enamel (asterisk) and only approaches the density seen in wild-type mice following eruption. Transverse sections show that secondary mineralization is compromised across the whole width of the enamel. (C) Homozygous EnamS55I do not exhibit any X-ray opaque material corresponding to incisor enamel. Only wild-type and heterozygous EnamS55I mice exhibit molar enamel (A and B). The molar teeth of all mice are fully erupted in these mice and no developing enamel is present.		PMC5411757_ddx090f5.jpg
