5,33429.0,Scientific Reports,"Erythrocyte ATP is required for merozoite invasion.(a) Method for quantifying merozoite invasion by flow cytometry. Free GFP-expressing merozoites are added to fresh erythrocytes in a 96-well plate format under agitation for 40 min. Samples are stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr), which labels the parasite nucleus, washed and run on a flow cytometer using a high-throughput plate reader. After gating on erythrocytes, the proportion of red blood cells invaded by merozoites can be quantified. Erythrocytes alone are GFP and EtBr low, while red blood cells with associated parasites and free merozoites are GFP high. EtBr distinguishes between erythrocytes with bound extracellular merozoites, which stain high, and those infected with new rings, which stain low. Here, a new ring-stage parasitemia of 4.5% was achieved, a population that is absent when the invasion assay was performed in the presence of the invasion inhibitor heparin.

6,137468.0,Nucleic Acids Research,"Cleavage of truncated phosphodiester and 3′-phosphorothiolate DNA substrates by WT BfiI and the WT/H105A heterodimer. The reactions contained 50–100 nM enzyme dimer and 1–2 nM radiolabeled DNA. The samples were collected and processed as described in ‘Materials and Methods’ section. (A and B) WT enzyme on the phosphodiester (3′-O) and 3′-phosphorothiolate (3′-S) substrates, 14/15 and 14/15s respectively. Cartoons above the graphs depict scissile linkages of the corresponding substrates. The time courses of intact substrate (filled symbols), covalent intermediate (open circles) and final product (open triangles) are shown: multiple data points at each time indicate values from repeat experiments. The inserts magnify the covalent intermediate data (&lt;2 and &lt;4% of total DNA for 3′-O and 3′-S substrates, respectively). Solid lines in both panels are the best fit of the experimental data to Equation (1) using a shared value of k2 for both substrates. The optimal fit gave k1(3′-O) = 2.1 ± 0.1 s−1, k1(3′-S) = 7.7 ± 0.1 s−1 and k2 = 170 ± 30 s−1. (C and D) The BfiI WT/H105A heterodimer on the 14/15 and 14/15s substrates. The heterodimer cleaved the 3′-S substrate 14/15s (filled circles), to form the covalent intermediate (open circles) and the final product (open triangles). The cartoon depicts the putative course of this reaction: upon mixing heterodimeric enzyme with the 14/15s substrate (the white box in the duplex marks the recognition site), only a fraction (A%) of DNA is bound by the enzyme in its active orientation capable of catalysis; the remaining fraction of the substrate (100-A%) may be cleaved only after re-binding of the enzyme in the active orientation (a slow process described by the rate constant k3). Solid lines are the optimal fit of this scheme to the 14/15s DNA cleavage data. The determined parameters are: k1 = 0.19 ± 0.02 s−1, k2 = 0.010 ± 0.001 s−1, k3 = 0.0014 ± 0.0002 s−1 and A = 54 ± 3%. Reactions of the WT/H105A heterodimer on the 3′-O substrate 14/15 are also shown (filled triangles).

The substantial synthetic lethality cannot be explained because there is no premature exit from mitosis. (B) HeLa cells that are BUB1-depleted and 17-AAG–treated exhibit DNA fragmentation (TUNEL+) during mitosis. 48 h after HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against MAD2, BUB1, or Luc, they were incubated with 17-AAG (+17AAG, 500 nM) for 24 h at 37°C. Fixed samples were stained by using an in situ cell death detection system that contained TMR red (red), an anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (p-H3) mouse monoclonal antibody, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (green). DNA was stained with DAPI (blue) to visualize prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase cells. Bar, 10 μm. (C) A histogram summarizing TUNEL assay results of BUB1- or MAD2-depleted cells. HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against MAD2, BUB1, or Luc were treated with 17-AAG (500 nM), NOC (0.5 μg/ml), or Taxol (10 nM) for 24 h at 37°C. DNA fragmentation was detected by the TUNEL assay, and samples underwent indirect fluorescence microscopy using anti–p-H3 as a primary antibody. More than 200 cells in three independent experiments were counted, and the mean percentages (± SD) of TUNEL+ cells and mitotic TUNEL+ cells (mitotic cells were those that were positive for p-H3 and had characteristic chromosome morphology) were calculated. Gray bars represent the mean percentages of TUNEL+ cells in the population, and black bars indicate the mean percentages of mitotic TUNEL+ cells.

Mitotic cells were isolated by pipetting (∼90% of the isolated population consisted of mitotic cells), and DNA was extracted and subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel (lane 2). As a negative control, DNA extracted from mitotic HeLa cells treated with 17-AAG (500 nM) was loaded (lane 1); and as a positive control, we loaded DNA extracted from HeLa cells treated with staurosporine (1 μM), a known inducer of apoptosis (lane 3). The molecular size markers (1-kb DNA ladder; New England Biolabs) are indicated (lane M). Fragmented DNA prepared from the same amount of cells was loaded into each lane.

The bar graph plots the global correlation of brain variability and each behavior measure or age (+/− bootstrap estimated standard error). As can be seen, for all three brain measures PLS detected similar global patterns of simultaneous negative correlation with cvRT, positive correlation with accuracy and age, and no stable correlation with mean RT.

51,121416.0,Plos Biology,"Phosphorylation of Ser582—loss of GPCR coupling of p110γ.In a resting mast cell, the PI3Kγ complex is responsive to GPCR-mediated dissociation of trimeric G proteins. An adapter protein (here p84) is required for a productive relay of the GPCR signal to PI3Kγ. When FcεRI receptors are clustered via IgE/antigen complexes, a signaling cascade is initiated, which triggers the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and the opening of store-operated Ca2+ channels. The resulting increase in [Ca2+]i and PLCγ-derived diacylglycerol activate PKCβ, which binds to p110γ and subsequently phosphorylates Ser582 (→pp110γ). Phosphorylated p110γ cannot interact with p84, and is therefore unresponsive to GPCR inputs. GPCR input to PI3Kγ coincides with migration and adhesion, while Ca2+/PKCβ activation of p110γ occurs when mast cells degranulate. The phosphorylation of PKB/Akt occurs downstream of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which originates from G protein-activated p84-p110γ complex or PKCβ-activated pp110γ. The phosphorylated residues Thr308 and Ser473 of PKB/Akt are used to monitor PI3K activation. More detailed effector signaling event schemes can be found in [52].",others-openset,https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/17/3692425/PMC3692425_pbio.1001587.g008.png,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692425,PMC3692425,PMC3692425_pbio.1001587.g008.jpg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692425/bin/pbio.1001587.g008.jpg

76,8991.0,Genome Biology,"LARD/TNFRSF12/DR3/Apo3 expression correlates with PTC+ status. LARD is an alternatively spliced death-domain-containing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (TNFR). However, only the major splice variant (isoform 1) contains the death domain and is capable of inducing apoptosis. The splicing distribution of LARD isoforms has been shown to change on lymphocyte activation, suggesting that alternative splicing may be a control point regulating lymphocyte proliferation [55]. (a) Screaton et al. [55] showed that, before lymphocyte activation, only LARD isoforms 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are expressed. Primary blood lymphocytes treated with an activating agent were found instead to express the major, apoptosis-promoting splice variant (isoform 1) almost exclusively. This panel is reproduced with permission from Figure 6a of [55] (© National Academy of Sciences). Screaton et al. [55] describe their figure as follows: &quot;Southern blots of reverse transcriptase-PCR of LARD cDNA with primers F LARD Kpn and R LARD Xba probed with 32P-labeled primer F LARD Xba.

The precise correlation between LARD isoform expression and PTC+ status hints that there may be a role for alternative-splicing-induced NMD. Here, the gene structures of these five isoforms are shown alongside that of the full-length LARD isoform (isoform 1).

155,118350.0,Frontiers In Immunology,"Schematic illustration of the possible cytokine flow pathway by which systemic inflammation changes the brain cytokine microenvironment. In response to systemic inflammation induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hippocampal vascular endothelial cells, leptomeningeal stromal cells, choroid plexus stromal cells, and choroid plexus epithelial cells produce early cytokines (such as CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and IL-6) at 4 h after LPS injection (red arrows). The receptors for these cytokines are expressed by astrocytic endfeet that are localized in close apposition to vascular endothelial cells and leptomeningeal cells. Thus, cytokine-mediated cell–cell interactions occur between the endothelial cells and the perivascular astrocytic endfeet, and between the leptomeningeal stromal cells and the subpial astrocytic endfeet. In addition, cytokines produced by choroid plexus stromal cells and epithelial cells may flow into the cerebrospinal fluid, and those produced by choroid plexus stromal cells may also flow into the brain parenchyma via the attachments of choroid plexus (red arrows). Thereafter, astrocytes produce late cytokines (such as CCL11, CXCL10, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) at 4–24 h after LPS injection (black arrows). An initial step in the activation of stromal cells in the leptomeninges and choroid plexus, and in the activation of choroid plexus epithelial cells, may be triggered by nearby myeloid cells, although this remains to be proven (black arrows with dotted line).

178,62213.0,Frontiers In Computational Neuroscience,"Network architecture and effects of NE modulation on different mode parameters. (A) Generalized network structure. OSNs that express a common receptor type project to a specific glomerulus, feeding into mitral (Mi), and periglomerular (PG) cells in that glomerulus. Mi cells are the principal output neurons of the OB and are modulated by PG and granule (Gr) inhibitory interneurons. In our model, each PG cell directly inhibits the mitral cell primary dendrite associated with the same glomerulus. Gr cells connect with Mi cells via reciprocal dendodendritic synapses, where Mi-Gr synapses are excitatory and Gr-Mi synapses are inhibitory. Each mitral cell is randomly connected to 40% of the granule cells, without any topological organization. Mi axons project to the PC, forming excitatory connections with pyramidal (Pyr) and feedforward (Ff) inhibitory interneurons which connect to apical dendrites of Pyr cells (30% connectivity), modulating bulbar input (Stokes and Isaacson, 2010), with each pyramidal cell receiving input from 20%, and each Ff interneuron from 40% of mitral cells. Pyr cells form autoassociative connections with 20% other Pyr cells as well as projecting to additional inhibitory interneurons, feedback (Fb) cells (Marr, 1971; Stokes and Isaacson, 2010). (B) Modulation of neural parameters by NE in the model [see Equation (1) for details]. In our model, NE affects Mi and Gr cells in the OB and Pyr and Fb cells in the PC. The graphs show how parameters in the model behave (y-axis) for different levels of NE concentration (x-axis). (Bi) shows how NE concentration affects Gr spontaneous firing by changing the spiking threshold (θmin) via α1 and α2 receptors (Nai et al., 2010). These receptors modulate Gr spontaneous activity in opposite directions, each with its own dose-response curve. Spontaneous firing increases as θmin increases. The graph in (Bii) shows how NE changes the excitability of Mi cells by modulation the saturation threshold θmax. Excitability, measured as responses to very low inputs, increases as θmax decreases. Finally, the graph in (Biii) shows how NE modulation changes parameters of Pyr and Fb cells as well as synaptic parameters in PC. PC parameters modulated with the dose response curve shown are excitatory synaptic transmission (reduced from 100 to 60%), the amplitude of the hyperpolarization current [Equation (5)], and qmin in Fb interneurons [Equation (3)].",graphs,https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/41/4468384/PMC4468384_fncom-09-00073-g0001.png,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468384,PMC4468384,PMC4468384_fncom-09-00073-g0001.jpg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468384/bin/fncom-09-00073-g0001.jpg

Dimethylated arginine was identified only with PRMT6 WT +/− SAM (R29; R35; R37). Dimethylated residues are represented with an (*) above the residue. (B) To evaluate the percentage of dimethylated arginine on PRMT6, ions corresponding to EAALERPR (m/z 471.26) and EAALER*PR (m/z 485.27) were extracted. Dimethylation was only observed in the WT protein and in the WT protein + SAM (not shown). There was no detectable signal at m/z 485.27 in the PRMT6 KLA mutant even when used at 10-fold the WT protein concentration. Areas under the curve (AUC) were studied for both peptides from the PRMT6 WT protein; assuming no differences in ionization efficiency, the methylated protein apparently represents 10 to 20% of total protein. MS/MS spectra observed for the methylated (C) EAALERPR and non-methylated (D) peptide of wild type PRMT6. Observed ions are indicated in bold. (E)In vivo methylation assays were performed in HeLa cells with transfected myc-tagged PRMT6. Samples were digested and processed as described for the in vitro methylation assays.

The upper left panel shows the landscape or potential energy function φ(x, θ), with a minimum at position, x = −0.5 (green dot) that exerts forces on the car. The car is shown at the target position at the top of the hill at x = 1 (red dot). The equations of motion of the car are shown below. Crucially, at x = 0 the force is unity and cannot be overcome by the agent, because a squashing function −1 ≤ σ(a) ≤ 1 is applied to action. This means the agent can only access the target by starting on the left hill to gain enough moment to carry it up the other side. The right panels show the cost function and empirical priors (model of flow) that constitute the agent. Cost is a function of position and a hidden (e.g., physiological) state that plays a role of satiety c(x, z) = (16 · exp⁡(−64(x−1)2) − 1)·(tanh(8(z − 1)) − 1) − 1.

Doxorubicin and related anthracyclines intercalate on DNA and induce DNA damage, as well as inducing free radical production, combining to preferentially induce the death of rapidly dividing tumor cells. However, cardiomyocytes may also undergo apoptosis, leading to decreased cardiac performance, and additional stress on the remaining cardiomyocytes. The present studies suggest that reduced cardiac expression of TCL1A leads to a reduced survival and protective effect of AKT1, making the cells more sensitive to apoptosis. Further, reduced cardiac expression of TCL1A/AKT could lead to reduced ABCB1/MDR1, and ABCB4, drug efflux pumps for doxorubicin, which would be expected to increase the intracellular levels of doxorubicin, as well as reducing the ability of the cardiomyocytes to export the free radicals that doxorubicin induces.",others-openset,https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/17/3638290/PMC3638290_ijbsv09p0350g06.png,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638290,PMC3638290,PMC3638290_ijbsv09p0350g06.jpg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638290/bin/ijbsv09p0350g06.jpg

The figure is based on the assumption that a retrovirus experiences: (1) an Xy- component of the SB denoted the Index of Origin or IO; (2) at Hs the index of entry or IE. The path of such a retrovirus is analogous to the trajectory of an object cast from one planet's gravitational and atmospheric field into another's. The path of such a physical phenomenon is described by Einstein's field equations of gravitation (Rμv-1/2 gμvR = 8 Tμv, where Rμ is the Ricci Tensor, gμv is the metric tensor, R is the Ricci scalar, and T is the all important Einstein's tensor) [43]. Analogously, at the port of sfv exit from Xy (where SB is defined by the IO), sfv shedding is (1) enhanced by the two transmitting tensors (Tt) and (2) opposed by the five accepting scalars (At), as described in the text.

To test whether Olig2 contributed to the repression of dorsal genes in pMN progenitors, Olig2 was ectopically induced in iNPC-D cells and the transcriptomes of these cells compared with iNPC-pMN progenitors. (F) Heatmap comparing the transcriptomes of iNPC-D, iNPC-pMN, and iNPC-p3 cells. Most of the dorsal genes that are repressed in p3 cells are also repressed in pMN progenitors. See also Table S1, sheet 3F. (G) Comparison of the transcriptomes of iNPC-D and iNPC-pMN with iNPC-D in which Olig2 had been induced. Olig2 is sufficient to downregulate 56% of the dorsal genes normally repressed in pMN at 36 hr.

Nkx2.2 and Olig2 bind to multiple intronic CREs of Gli3. Nkx2.2, Olig2, and Nkx6.1 bind to intronic CRE of Scube2. Nkx6.1 binds two intergenic enhancers to repress Pax3. Two clusters of genes repressed cooperatively by Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.1 are bound by either Nkx2.2 (Hes3 and Gpr153) or Nkx6.1 (Klhl14 and 4930426D05Rik) in their vicinity, whereas the other NP-TFs bind further away, separated by several genes that are either not expressed or not differentially regulated in neural progenitors. Thus, genes repressed strongly by Nkx2.2 and weakly by Nkx6.1 seem to be regulated through partially shared CREs (Scube2), whereas genes that require both Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.1 for full repression are regulated through exclusively separate CREs (Table S4). Note also that Nkx2.2 and Olig2 often share regulatory elements controlling expression of dorsal genes. ∗padj &lt; 0.05.",others-openset,https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/221/4819439/PMC4819439_gr3.png,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819439,PMC4819439,PMC4819439_gr3.jpg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819439/bin/gr3.jpg

(E) SEC-MALS analysis of the deletion variants shown in (D) carried out on a Superdex 75 10/30 gel filtration column. Variants with a single segment deleted have masses that are consistent with dimers (capΔ, stalkΔ and tailΔ).

The C terminusΔ construct consists of residues 123 to 226, corresponding to a calculated mass of 14 kDa. Both SEC-MALS and intact mass spectrometry (Fig. S17) are consistent with a mass of approximately 11 kDa, suggesting that there has been some proteolysis of the construct during expression or purification from E. coli.

586,130635.0,Bmc Biochemistry,"Changes in catalytic specificity (kcat/Km) reflect underlying changes in transition state binding energy (ΔGb) In this description of catalysis, (i) the magnitude of the non-catalysed activation energy () does not depend on a favourable protein-substrate interaction in the transition state, (ii) the catalysed translocation energy barrier is taken as the Gibbs Energy difference () between the free reactants (C + S) and the transition state complex (CS‡), and (iii) intrinsic substrate binding energy is recognizable as the decisive factor in transition state stabilization. Thus, translocation catalysts (C) will use intrinsic substrate binding energy (ΔGb) to stabilize the transition state (CS‡). The role of ΔGb in lowering the transition state energy barrier compared to a non-catalyzed reaction () may be deduced with aid from the accompanying energy diagrams, which emphasize several instances wherein the thermodynamic distance represented by one coloured arrow equals the summed distance represented by two shorter arrows of the same colour. The illustrated thermodynamic relationships are restated (with proper attention to sign convention) in equations A (red), B (green), and C (blue). Substituting A and C into B yields the fundamental relationship,  (boxed), which says that the uncatalysed activation energy (, algebraically positive) is diminished by intrinsic substrate binding energy, ΔGb (algebraically negative), which is the underlying parameter that TSR analysis probes (Eqn. 9). Note: These energy diagrams compare non-catalytic (dots and dashes) and catalytic (solid line) proteins. Imposition of a binding-averse interaction (ΔGR) is seen to de-stabilize the Michaelis complex (CS, red arrows) in the catalytic protein. Subsequent attainment of favourable transition state complementarity (i.e., via conformational transitions that relieve ΔGR , blue arrows) results in use of binding energy to stabilize the transition state complex (CS‡). This internal ''give-and-take,'' involving ΔGR is reflected in its algebraic cancellation when equations A, B, and C are combined to yield the boxed equation (text Eqn. 1), which says that intrinsic substrate binding energy decreases the energy barrier () for a translocation reaction carried out from solution (i.e., directly from the free carrier and substrate (C + S) to the transition state). When C and S are free in solution, the effective second-order rate constant associated with  is kcat/Km, the specificity parameter compared in the dual-substrate TSR analysis (Equation.5). That kcat/Km should be associated with the free reactants may be appreciated by considering the Michaelis-Menten Equation when S &lt;&lt; Km, and CS complexes do not exist in appreciable amounts (see Discussion).",others-openset,https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/512/226/535561/PMC535561_1471-2091-5-16-5.png,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC535561,PMC535561,PMC535561_1471-2091-5-16-5.jpg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC535561/bin/1471-2091-5-16-5.jpg
